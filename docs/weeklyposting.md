## Weekly Website Updates
### Monday: Post Sunday Service
Each Monday, the previous day's service should be published on the website. This involves creating a new Markdown file with the following structure:

```
---
layout: post
title: "Sunday Service (SERMON TITLE GOES HERE)"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
image: /images/video/YYYY-MM-DD.jpg
author: wade (or mark)
video_embed: "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID"
tags: [video]
---

Sermon description goes here.
```

Steps:
1. Find the video
  * Go to the church's YouTube channel.
  * The video ID is the string after `v=` in the URL (e.g., in `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI7PB0GGum0`, the ID is `QI7PB0GGum0`).

2. Get the sermon title and description
  * Open Twist and go to the [Worship Planning channel](https://twist.com/a/155663/ch/417281/).
  * Locate the thread for the relevant service date.
  * The title and description are typically provided in that thread.

3. Choose an image
  * Use a high-quality, royalty-free image that reflects the sermonâ€™s theme or liturgical season.
  * YouTube's autogenerated thumbnails are available but often low quality. Use your judgment.

4. Save files
  * Image: Name it `YYYY-MM-DD.jpg` (or `.png`, etc.) and place it in the `/images/video/` folder.
  * Markdown file: Name it `SS.md` and place it in `/posts/video/`.

5. Merge to main
  * Once the updates are made, commit and merge the changes into the main branch.

### Friday: Post Upcoming Bulletin
Each Friday, post the bulletin for the upcoming Sunday.

Steps:
1. Check the bulletin repository
  * Carolyn usually uploads the bulletin to https://github.com/uccdga/files/tree/main/bulletins in the early afternoon.

2. Update the bulletin list
  * Edit https://github.com/uccdga/site/blob/main/_data/publications.yml to add an entry for the new bulletin.

3. Merge to main
  * Once the update is made, commit and merge the changes into the main branch.
