As we move through the Advent season and into the Christmas celebrations, please note some important changes to our worship schedule.

**December 21: Christmas Cantata**  We will gather for one combined service at 11 AM on December 21 as our choir presents the Christmas Cantata. This is an exciting milestone for us, as this is the first year we have presented a cantata in a number of years. Gathering together as one congregation makes this celebration even more special. Plan to invite family and friends as we celebrate the birth of Christ through music and worship.

**December 28: New Year Prayer Service**  On December 28, we will again gather for one service at 11 AM for our New Year Prayer Service. As we prepare to enter a new year, this will be a time to reflect on God's faithfulness in the past year and seek His guidance for the year ahead. It's a beautiful way to close out 2025 and welcome 2026 with our church family.

**Resuming Two Services**  Beginning Sunday, January 4, we will resume our regular two-service schedule at 8:45 AM and 11 AM. We look forward to continuing our winter worship together as we move into the new year.

Mark these dates on your calendars, and we'll see you at 11 AM on both December 21 and 28!
