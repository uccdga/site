## What’s Happened…

### One Great Hour of Sharing
In November, families participated in our **One Great Hour of Sharing mission project**. Each day, they read a sharing calendar and contributed coins to a fish bank as directed. We’re now collecting these fish banks and eagerly await seeing how God multiplies these gifts to bless others.

### Metro World Child Stocking Project
On November 6th, our **Youth Club kids filled 52 stockings** for Metro World Child. These stockings were sent to Brooklyn and will be distributed during a special Christmas program where families also hear the gospel message. 

This effort was a true team success! From felt cutters and stocking sewers to stocking stuffer donations and the kids’ creativity, everyone played a part. Please pray that these stockings bring tangible evidence of Christ’s love to the children who receive them.

## What’s Happening…

### Christmas Angel Tree
The **Christmas Angel Tree** is up in the gathering area, brimming with gift tags for local needs in partnership with St. Benedict’s Parish. After choosing a tag, please purchase the items and return wrapped gifts (with the tag attached) to the church by **Sunday, December 8th**. Your generosity is a reflection of God’s abundant provision—thank you!

For questions, contact Deb Marshall.

We’re thrilled to introduce a **new Christmas Pageant** this season! 
- **Practice:** Saturday, December 14th, 9:30–11:00 AM in the sanctuary.

### Advent Devotionals
Advent, the four weeks before Christmas, invites us to prepare our hearts for the coming Messiah. Devotionals are available for children and youth, tailored to different age groups:

- **Preschool–Kindergarten:** "O Little Town of Bethlehem" (Build Bethlehem with stickers and daily readings).
- **1st–3rd Grade:** "Time for a Savior" (Family-oriented daily devotions).
- **4th–5th Grade:** "Rejoice in Hope" (Scripture, reflection, prayer, and action).
- **Middle School:** "Oh, Come On, It’s Advent" (Teen-focused scripture and reflections).
- **High School:** Select offerings curated by Pastor Mark.

Advent begins **December 1st**. We encourage families to set aside time each day to share in the anticipation of Jesus’ birth. O Come, Let Us Adore Him!

## Personal Reflection

I recently read this quote from Elizabeth Elliot: 
"Rest is a weapon given to us by God. The enemy hates it because he wants us to be stressed and occupied."

This perspective struck me. I’ve often heard that "rest is a gift" or "rest is a command," but I hadn’t thought of it as a weapon. If the enemy wants us stressed and occupied, shouldn’t we actively pursue the opposite? Jesus offers us peace—a peace that surpasses understanding, and that feels like the antidote to stress.

But how do we wield rest as a weapon in our daily lives? For me, it starts with structuring my days to include time with the Lord, exercise, family, and work. I also reserve one day a week as Sabbath—a day not driven by tasks but by joy and relaxation. 

As we enter Advent, let’s commit to resting once a week, even amid the busyness. May you find peace and freedom as you use rest as a weapon against the enemy, and may you notice how much better you feel!

"Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest." (Exodus 23:12a)
