We want to ensure that our church family stays informed when it matters most. If you’re comfortable, we invite you to complete a Consent-to-Text Form, allowing us to send you urgent messages through Planning Center.

These texts will be used only for important updates, such as last-minute service changes, weather-related cancellations, or urgent church-wide notifications. You won’t receive replies from others, and you won’t be able to reply—just quick, essential updates when needed.

Thank you for helping us keep our church family connected! If you have any questions, please contact the church office.

Signing up is quick and easy! Simply fill out [this form](https://bit.ly/ucc-consent)
