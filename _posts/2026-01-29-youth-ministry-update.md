**Sunday School** - Our  **Middle School**  and  **High School classes**  continue. Now that pageant practice is over, we have returned to our MS/HS activity time at the beginning of Sunday School, which supports relationship building and cultivates some Sunday morning energy. Both groups continue to use the LIVE curriculum, with Middle School going through "Bible 101" and High School going through "God is Pursuing".

**High School Youth Group (The Cause)**  - We are currently working through Romans 10 and 12. In January, our students are in a "Preach-it Teach-it" series where they make their own lessons, with a plan to produce a Bible Study for the Middle School Youth Club students. Our youth band continues to practice and grow, with plans for Sunday morning worship. Dinner time is still largely supported by our parents - thank you!

**Youth Club Middle School Group Bible Study**  - This class is following the same studies as the high school group. Like the HS'ers, they will produce a Bible Study for younger students, and then use the HS-produced Bible Study lesson themselves. Our group is large, so we split Bible time into two rotating groups, with the other group enjoying activity time (often in the same theme as the lesson).

**School District Connects**  - Our mid-week connects continue, with Victor, Marcus Whitman, and Canandaigua connects active. Our homeschooling connect is being planned for February.

**Youth Ice Skating Event & Annual Meeting Fundraiser**  - We planned an ice-skating event for our middle school and high school students (January 24). This was be coupled with efforts to prep for the annual meeting (January 25). Thank you all for supporting our youth program and mission experiences!

**February Special Events**

-   We will be hosting our  **Souper Bowl of Caring fundraiser**  (February 8th). Funds raised will be donated to Canandaigua Christian Churches in Action (CCIA).
