*Seeing one another with care-filled eyes....*

In any church family, there are needs that sit quietly beneath the surface. A warm smile might hide a weary heart. A quick greeting may mask the ache of loneliness. Someone faithfully showing up each Sunday may be quietly carrying the weight of grief, illness, or caregiving fatigue.

These needs are often hidden, not because people don't want support, but because pain can be hard to name, and life rarely slows down long enough to let us see each other clearly.

As we move into the slower rhythm of summer, let's take time to look again. Let's listen more closely, ask intentional questions, and extend compassion with no strings attached. You don't need to have all the answers, your presence, your listening ear, and your willingness to check in can open the door to healing connection.

And when the Spirit nudges you toward someone, whether it's through a name that comes to mind, or a face you haven't seen in a while, respond with care. A call. A card. A coffee date. A prayer.

Often, the very people who seem "fine" are the ones who most need to know they are seen, loved, and not alone.
