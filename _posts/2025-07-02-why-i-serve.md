**Julie Z.**:

> _"I love serving within our church family, and I thank God that He has given me the willingness and desire to do so. So I guess the super short answer to 'Why do I serve?' is, because He's given me the ability and heart to do it. Beautifully, in the process of responding to His gift, there are even more blessings! Relationship building, camaraderie, laughter, good conversation, purpose, and joy, to name just a few."_

> _"I've heard it said that a great way to feel better when you're feeling down is to do something for someone else. It takes our eyes off our own troubles, builds our self-esteem, and brings a sense of purpose. We live in a broken world, and it's common to feel too overwhelmed to think about serving someone else. And while it's true that sometimes we do need to step back from commitments, I can't think of a single time I wasn't blessed by stepping out and serving."_

> _"There are so many ways to serve in our church, some require a larger time commitment, and some are smaller. The Meal Train, Support Team, and Transportation Teams all require just a small commitment. These teams are designed to be large so that members can help only when they're able, and the needs are still met. I feel like this structure allows the Holy Spirit to direct our steps, making the right people available at the right time. The commitment is small, but the impact is big. These teams do more than deliver a meal, move a piece of furniture, or drive someone to an appointment--they provide hope and love to a church member right when they need it most."_

> _"I'd like to thank all our church staff for the effort they put into organizing our many service opportunities."_

(Julie serves within the Care Ministry on the Helping Hands Teams: Transportation, Meal Train, and Support Team, as well as other ministries throughout our church.)

**Thank you, Julie, for allowing God to work through you as you serve others with compassion and joy!**

**Robin P.:**
**What drew you to serving on the Care Team?**

_I have always enjoyed helping others and was looking for a new way to serve the church. This church has always been there for me, and I wanted to give back._

**What's something meaningful you have experienced while serving?**

_I experience the joy of bringing love to others, both God's love and mine, and I love learning about others' journeys with God._

**How has this role impacted your faith or connection to our church family?**

_By learning about others' faith journeys, I've grown in my own. It has helped me feel more connected to our church family._

**Why would you encourage someone else to serve on a Care Team?**

_I would encourage someone to join our team because helping your church family strengthens your relationship with God._

(Robin serves others as a Care Minister. She also volunteers on the Helping Hands Support Team.)

**Thank you, Robin, for the heart and care you bring to our ministry!**
