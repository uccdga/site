In April of 2025, 19 individuals of all ages went to Swannanoa, NC (just east of Asheville) to assist in hurricane relief. It was seven months after Hurricane Helene devastated the area and much work still needed to be done. We worked on home repairs, debris pick up and food distribution through Valley Hope Foundation. It was a meaningful week for all who participated through the work we did, the people we met, and the relationships within our group that were made.

There continues to be a need for help – it will take them many years to recover. We are planning to have a return trip to Swannanoa March 28 – April 3, 2026. This is school break week so all can participate!! Contact Sonya Brooks (<sonya.brooks99@yahoo.com>) with any questions.
