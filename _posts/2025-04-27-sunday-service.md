With both pastors away, one of our church elders, Jim Boseck, shared a message on living a life focused on praising God. He reminded us that praise isn’t just for Sundays - it should be a daily response to God's goodness. Even in hard times, we’re called to honor God with our words, attitudes, and actions, making praise a way of life.
