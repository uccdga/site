**Youth Club**: Our Youth Club year wrapped up in April with LOTS of fun! On April 23rd, we had first graders visit Youth Club, which also meant the middle schoolers got to go out for one last dinner at Tom Wahls!! Then on April 30th, we celebrated our Youth Club year together with a carnival and a special closing program and pizza dinner with Youth Club families. We are thankful to God for another year of ministry to children and their families. All glory to Him! 

**Camp**: *Parents*, don’t forget that we offer **camperships**!! Our church believes that the Christian camp experience is so important that **we will pay half the cost** for **one week** at any **Christian day camp** or **overnight camp**! This is *not* a need based scholarship – this is for every family sending a child to Christian camp this summer! The only qualification is that your child currently participates in Sunday School, Sunday morning services, Youth Club, and/or The Cause.  So, sign up for camp, send the registration confirmation to Deb, and we will take care of the campership. We sent 27 kids to camp last year; let’s try to send more this year!!!

**Sunday School**: In **May**, we will wrap up our Sunday school year for all ages. We like to remember and celebrate our year together with a **Sunday School celebration breakfast**, which will happen on **May 18th at 9:45am**. All are welcome to join us for this special time together! Please bring a dish to pass if you’re able. 

**Nursery**: Once we transition to summer 9:30am services, on May 25, we also transition to asking people to **volunteer** each week for **nursery duty**. We do this because summer schedules are busy and it is difficult to “pre-schedule” people for summer Sundays. Even if you don’t usually volunteer in the nursery, you can **sign up to help once or twice during the summer**. *All nursery volunteers need to be background checked* – you can ask Carolyn about how to get a background check – it’s quick and easy! **Thank you** so much for **sharing in this ministry** to the **youngest in our church family**!
