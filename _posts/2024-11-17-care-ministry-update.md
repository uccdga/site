# Celebrating Our Senior Companions

## Honoring Esther Pullis and Ernestine Eveleigh

This December, we joyfully celebrate the birthdays of two cherished members of our Senior Companions group: Esther and Ernestine. These remarkable women bring warmth, wisdom, and a vibrant sense of community to our church family.

### Esther Pullis - December 14

Esther Pullis turns 94 this month! Her journey has been marked by service and faithfulness as she supported her husband, Claude, in Baptist ministry across the United States. Since retiring to Canandaigua in the 1990s, Esther has welcomed countless individuals to our church with her radiant smile and heartfelt invitations to worship. She continues to attend services and remains a beloved presence within our congregation. Happy Birthday, Esther, and may your year ahead be filled with blessings!

### Ernestine Eveleigh - December 31

Ernie has lived a life rich in family and love. Together with her husband, Mac, she raised five sons and now cherishes her eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Splitting her time between a cottage on the St. Lawrence River during the summer and her home in Canandaigua, Ernie has become an active participant in our church, even joining the Knitting Club with her daughter-in-law. We are grateful for the joy and creativity she brings to our community. Happy Birthday, Ernie!
