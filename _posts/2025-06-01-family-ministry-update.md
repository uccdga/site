## Summer Camp

We have **22 children** signed up to attend Christian summer camp. You have the opportunity to connect with one (or some) of them by writing a camp note! In the month of June, a “**camp note tree**” will be out in the gathering area with **pre-addressed envelopes**. Inside you will find a card and **information about the camper** that you are writing to. You will also see **when you need to mail their card**, as some campers go to camp at the end of June and some don’t go until August. Our campers are listed in the weekly bulletin so that you can pray for them as well. We hope you enjoy connecting with the children and youth attending camp this summer!

## VBS

We are preparing for **True North VBS**, which will be held **July 14-18, from 9am-12noon**. We need lots of help - both to prepare and during the week of VBS. How will YOU be involved? There are MANY options! You can take a supply donation tag off the board in the Welcome Center and **donate needed items**; you can **volunteer** during the week of VBS; you can pick up VBS prayer cards in the Welcome Center and **pray for our VBS** and/or you can **join a scenery work day** and create our wilderness/northern lights themed décor. **We would love your help!** If you have questions about VBS, please see Deb Marshall.

There are some ways you can help with VBS right now! You are invited to join us for a VBS scenery work day. Come for as long as you can. We have a lot of different ways you can help. We have scheduled two work days so far: Tuesday May 27, 9am-12noon and Monday, June 2, 9am-12noon

We also need some donations for VBS. We have created an Amazon wishlist for some items. Here’s the link: [https://a.co/iJlxUDh](https://a.co/iJlxUDh). We also need to borrow the following items: artificial Christmas trees (any size), a canoe, and one or two wooden paddles. Stay tuned - there will be many more donations needed as we continue planning. Thanks in advance for your support!

## Nursery

We need some **help in our nursery this summer**. Each Sunday, we need **2 people in the nursery** to lovingly care for the youngest in our church family. We ask that people **sign up for nursery duty** during the summer months since summer schedules often include being out of town on weekends. If you know you’ll be in town, and you enjoy babies and toddlers, might you consider helping out? You can sign up using the **church center or services app** for a Sunday that works for you. Please note that all people 18 and over who volunteer in the nursery need to be background checked – this is a quick and easy process! Contact Carolyn to be checked. 

## **Graduate Sunday!**
  
On Sunday, June 8, we will **celebrate our graduates**! If you have a **high school grad or college grad** in your family, please plan to **join us** for **Graduate Sunday** at **9:30am on June 8**. High school graduates will be called up front and college grads will be recognized. All graduates will be prayed for during the service. After the service, all are invited to enjoy a **cake and punch reception**.
