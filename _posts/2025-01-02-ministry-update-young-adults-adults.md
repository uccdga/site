A group of **young adults** (our group this year is primarily college-aged students) are preparing for the January 2025 trip to Atlanta for the Passion Conference! Please keep them in your prayers as they prepare their hearts and minds to worship the Lord and engage in the Scriptures with thousands of other young adults.

The **women's group** (a 20/30-something ministry) continues to meet at our church every other week or so. The Christian club at FLCC also continues, with Wendy Bacon supporting this cl

The **Adult Education Sunday School Hour** continues! Our Bible Study class ended their Genesis series, and (as of this writing in Mid-December) are discerning 2025 classes. We also continue to host the Parenting Coffee Hour. This casual group has covered a number of topics, including forgiveness, strengthening our faith, seeking what matters to God, patience, taking risks, and more.

As always, Adults in our church are engaged in various **small group ministries**. To name a few, we have our Men's breakfast, Women's circles, Bible study groups, knitting group, and prayer shawl knitting. In October, Jen Eveleigh and I hosted a small group facilitator information meeting, and are taking next steps towards new small group formation! Some new small groups have already formed, and other potential facilitators are considering what they'd like to do.

Our **monthly connect** at Ferris Hills on the first Wednesday of the month continues (we have an exception for January... we meet December 8!). Discernment for more monthly connects for adults continues!

The **Adult Education Ministry Team** continues to meet every other month or so. This year, our team includes: Brenda and Bob Cunningham, Steve Simpson, Gary Preece, Gail Benjamin, Adam Thorman, Bev Fehrenbach, and Melissa Long. In December, Joan Danaher will be joining the team, too!
