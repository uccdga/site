We are excited to introduce six wonderful individuals who are stepping into a new role within our church family--as Care Ministers.

Each of these individuals has a heart for serving others and a meaningful history of offering care, encouragement, and spiritual support. After meeting with our Care Team and prayerfully discerning together, it became clear that these six embody the compassion, wisdom, and presence needed for this important ministry.

Our new Care Ministers are:

**June P., Jinnilee H., Robin P., Bill F., Nancy B., and Aleta W.**

In the coming weeks, they will begin a training process to equip them further for this role. Once completed, they will be formally commissioned during a worship service, and we will celebrate and pray over their ministry together as a congregation.

Care Ministers are a vital extension of our church's ministry to those experiencing illness, loss, isolation, or other life challenges. Through visits, phone calls, prayer, and presence, they will help ensure that no one in our church family feels alone in their time of need.

If you feel called to join this ministry and would like to learn more about becoming a Care Minister, please contact Christy. We are always looking for compassionate individuals who wish to share God's love with others in a meaningful way.

We give thanks for the willingness of these six individuals to serve and look forward to the many ways their care will reflect Christ's love in our community.
