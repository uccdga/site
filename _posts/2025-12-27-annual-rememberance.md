On  **Sunday, January 25, 2026**, a portion of our late worship service will be dedicated to our  **Annual Remembrance**, a meaningful tradition in which we honor those of our church family who have passed into God's care during the past year.

During this brief time, we will speak the names of our loved ones, accompanied by a bell chime, and reflect on Jesus' promise:  _"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die."_

This moment offers gentle space for gratitude, healing, and hope within the larger flow of worship.

We welcome you, and your family and friends, to join us as we remember together. Whether you come carrying recent grief or simply wish to support others, your presence is a blessing. May this time remind us that we do not walk through loss alone:  **God is near, and we walk together as a community held in His love.**

> _"He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds."_  Psalm 147:3
