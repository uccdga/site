**Happy Birthday, Esther P.!**

Born on  **December 14, 1930**, in Hollywood, California, Esther grew up in Los Angeles and later moved to Philadelphia, where she married Claude in 1957. Their family includes Stephen, Lynne, five grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.

After retiring to Canandaigua in 1995, Claude and Esther joined The United Church. Since moving to Quail Summit in 2018, Esther has enjoyed watching the Hallmark Channel and listening to easy-listening music.

We wish Esther a very happy birthday and a year filled with blessings!

**Happy Birthday, Ernie M.!**

We are celebrating Ernie Mackenzie's 94th birthday on **December 31st**. She and her husband, Mac, recently moved in with her son and daughter-in-law, John and Jen E. where she is enjoying watching the birds and wildlife. She grew up in the North Country so cold and snow is nothing new to her. She has a real sweet tooth and she likes the color blue. Ernie's Dad worked on the railroad so she has fond memories of going down to see him and the trains. Ernie attended Nursing School in New York City. I'm sure she has stories of the city and how it has changed. Happy Birthday Ernie.
