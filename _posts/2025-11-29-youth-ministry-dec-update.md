**Sunday School** - Our  **Middle School**  and  **High School classes**  continue. Our students currently attend a pageant practice the first part of the Sunday school hour.

**High School Youth Group (The Cause)**  - Our program year is going along strong! Now that we are in holiday season, special activities - such as Christmas decorating and celebrations - provide a break from our routines. Of special note, the youth group responded to the needs in our community mid-November and participated in a shopping trip to buy goods to donate.

**Youth Club Middle School Group Bible Study**  - This class is following the same studies as the high school group. Our group recently enjoyed dinner out at Tom Wahls, and we were grateful for how well-behaved our large group was.

**School District Connects**  - Our mid-week connects continue, with Victor, Marcus Whitman, and Canandaigua connects active. Our homeschooling connect has been hard to plan logistically - continued efforts to make this work are underway.

**Youth Fall Event**  - Our middle school and high school students enjoyed a Fall event in October, which included a trip to the Pick'n Patch, pumpkin carving, dinner, devotions, and fun/games. A special thanks to Julie Zajac for her efforts to coordinate this event.

**Christmas Decorating**  - Late-November, our high school youth group combined with a Christmas decorating event, which included worship (led by the youth group) for everyone, a time of decorating, and a Thanksgiving meal for the high school students (a separate pizza party was provided for other helpers).

**Christmas Mall Trip**  - Mid-December, our annual mall trip is planned (December 13!), this time after the pageant practice on a Saturday. This will allow for more time at the mall (to allow sufficient time for shopping). We will also spend time at the church, including a devotional. Please register for this event online.
