_Thank You Care Ministry...  
Stephen and I are so touched by your gesture of support and cannot adequately express our gratitude for the many ways our church family has helped to shoulder our burdens. The love and support we've received have brought peace and comfort, relief and hope, and most importantly, God's love and continued care into our life. We are most certainly not walking alone through this challenging season._

_Blessings,  
Kory and Stephen_

_Dear Stewards,  
I thank you for all of the lovely cards, caring messages and prayers. They warm my heart and are always an encouragement._

_God Bless you,  
Ernestine M._
