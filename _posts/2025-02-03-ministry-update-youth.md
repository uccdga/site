**Youth Groups:** Our weekly high school program (known as The Cause, an extension of our Youth Club ministry) continues with the curriculum titled "Can I Ask That? Hard Questions about God and Faith". Our middle school program (part of our Youth Club ministry) continues with our Deep Discipleship curriculum.

**Sunday School:** Middle School and High School continue with Deep Discipleship as our curriculum. 

**Special Events:** For February, we will be hosting our Souper Bowl of Caring fundraiser (February 9th). Funds raised will be donated to Canandaigua Christian Churches in Action (CCIA). 

**Monthly Connects:** As always, our monthly school district connects (including Victor, Canandaigua, and Marcus Whitman) continue! Check the church calendar for dates.
