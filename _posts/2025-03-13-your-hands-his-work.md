Have you ever prayed for God to show you a way to serve? A way to make a real difference in someone's life? What if the answer is as simple as changing a lightbulb, raking leaves, or picking up groceries?

The needs within our church family are many. Some members struggle with everyday tasks--small things that become overwhelming when health, age, or life circumstances make them difficult to manage. That's where the Support Team comes in.

We are looking for hearts willing to serve and hands ready to help. No long-term commitment. No set schedule. Just a willingness to step in when you can--whether it's running an errand, tackling a seasonal chore, doing light housework, or assisting with a small repair.

Think of it as answering a prayer with your presence. Someone in our church family is hoping for a little help today. Could you be the answer?

Join the Support Team and say "yes" to serving when you're able. Your time, no matter how small, makes a big difference.
