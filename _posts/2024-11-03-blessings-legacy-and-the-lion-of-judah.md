This sermon explores Genesis 49, where Jacob offers blessings and prophecies for each of his sons before his death. These words reflect the character and actions of Jacob’s sons and point forward to the future of Israel’s tribes, with a particular focus on Judah’s lineage leading to Jesus, the “Lion of Judah.” The sermon emphasizes the importance of legacy, showing how our actions today impact future generations, and connects the biblical story to our participation in God’s redemptive work through Christ.
