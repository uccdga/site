Over the past year, new teams within the Care Ministry have quietly stepped up to support church members in times of need. From offering rides, preparing meals, visiting with those who are homebound or recovering, helping to move furniture and simply being present to pray or check in--these volunteers are living out our call to love and care for one another in meaningful ways.

Ann, a member of our church family, recently experienced this care firsthand following hip surgery. Living alone and returning home the day after her procedure, she found herself in need of both practical help and companionship.

> "I had not driven since Fall," she shared, "and even before the surgery, I was given rides to doctor appointments. This was a lifesaver for me."

What started as transportation help quickly became something deeper.

> "As time went on, I got to know one couple in particular who now takes the time to call and check on me," Ann said. "They even called to wish me a happy birthday. Another gentleman gave me his number so I could reach out if I needed anything."

She also received meals from the Meal Train team, which offered more than nourishment.

> "The meals were very helpful and delicious," she said. "But the best part was when someone brought the meal--it was the company and conversation that I needed."

Visitors, phone calls, meals, and rides all worked together to meet her needs during a difficult season.

> "My friends were very impressed with the help United Church provided," Ann said with gratitude.

We are thankful for the many volunteers on the Helping Hands Transportation Team and Meal Train Team who are showing up with compassion and care. They remind us that even simple acts of service can offer deep encouragement--and that we are better when we walk through life together.
