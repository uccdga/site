**Sunday school:**  Our Sunday school year is off to a great start! Children ages 3-years-old through High School are welcome to join their age/grade based class on  _any_  Sunday. We also offer classes for adults; right now we are offering small group studies on 2 Peter. Nursery care is offered for infants and toddlers so that everyone can participate in the Sunday school hour. When it works for your family’s schedule, we hope you will join us at 9:45am!

**The Cause**  for 9th-12th grade students, Sundays, 5:00-7:30pm, mid-September - mid-June

Please join us during either service on September 28 for our LOGOS dedication when we come before the Lord to ask His guidance and blessings upon our LOGOS students and workers for this coming year.
