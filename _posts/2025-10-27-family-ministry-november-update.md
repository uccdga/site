**Youth Club,**  our Wednesday afterschool ministry for children in 2nd-8th grade, is off to a great start with 56 children registered for the program! After school, we enjoy the four parts that make up Youth Club, which are: Recreation, Bible Study, Worship, and Family Time, which includes dinner.
