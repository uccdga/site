Each December, on the first Sunday of the month, our Sunday offering includes a special opportunity to give to the Stewards Assistance Fund. Any loose change received that day also goes toward this ministry.

During this season of giving, your generosity quietly blesses those in our church family facing unexpected needs, sharing the true spirit of Christmas through Christ's love and care.

If you know of someone who could benefit from extra support, especially during the holidays, please reach out to Christy.
