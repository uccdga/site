Join us for a fantastic Game Night at The United Church in Canandaigua on **Sunday, November 12, at 7 PM**! This special event promises an evening filled with laughter, friendly competition, and community connection. Whether you’re a serious board game fan or just looking for a casual night out with friends and neighbors, Game Night has something for everyone.

## A Variety of Games for All Ages

We’ve planned a wide range of games to appeal to different ages and interests, ensuring that everyone can join in on the fun. Expect classic board games like *Settlers of Catan* and *Ticket to Ride*, as well as card games and group favorites such as *Pictionary* and *Charades*. 

Never played these games before? No problem! Friendly volunteers will be on hand to help explain the rules and make sure everyone feels included. The atmosphere is relaxed, and the focus is on having fun, making it easy for people to try out new games without any pressure. 

## Enjoy Snacks and Refreshments

No game night would be complete without some delicious snacks and refreshments, and The United Church will have plenty available. Light snacks, beverages, and possibly a few homemade treats will be on hand, adding to the enjoyment and creating a great setting for conversation between games. Feel free to bring a favorite snack to share with others—sharing food is a wonderful way to connect and make everyone feel at home.

## Building Community and Connection

At The United Church, we value community and connection, and Game Night is one of the many ways we foster these bonds. In today’s digital world, opportunities for face-to-face interaction can feel rare, so we’re thrilled to host an event that encourages in-person connection. Game Night offers a relaxed setting where people can laugh, share stories, and enjoy each other’s company.

Rev. [Your Pastor’s Name] notes, “Game Night reflects our commitment to building a welcoming community where everyone feels at home. This is a space for friendships to grow, for new people to feel included, and for everyone to experience the joy of gathering together.”

Whether you’re new to the church or a longtime member, Game Night is a great opportunity to meet people and make new friends in a fun, casual setting.

## Bring a Friend and Just Show Up!

This event is open to all ages, and attendees are encouraged to bring family members, friends, or neighbors who might enjoy a night of games and good company. There’s no need to RSVP—just show up ready to play and connect! Our church is thrilled to welcome people from all walks of life, and no church affiliation is necessary. We simply want everyone to feel welcome and valued.
