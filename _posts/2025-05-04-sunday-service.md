Using the Acronym ACT: *Appreciate* Psalm 30’s place in history as a song of temple dedication. *Consider* how it reflects David’s life, Israel’s relationship with God, and our redemption in Christ (as temples ourselves / the church). *Thank* God for hearing our cries, turning mourning into dancing, and giving us eternal life in Christ.
