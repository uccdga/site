## February 25 Happy Birthday Bob Ledgerwood!

Bob has been a member of the United Church for many years. He regularly attended services until his health declined. He still attends a weekly Bible Study.

Bob has two daughters and eight Grand Children who visit often. He enjoys seeing them but admits it is tiring on holiday visits.
Bob enjoys watching football and TV westerns. He is an expert on anything to do with the Beatles and has an office wall of Beatles pictures and records. Bob's favorite lunch is Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich and is not a fan of Meals On Wheels liver.
Bob enjoys the fellowship of Stewards lunches and continues to be a cherished member of the United Church.
