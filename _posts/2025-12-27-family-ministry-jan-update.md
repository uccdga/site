**Sunday school:**  During the month of November, our Sunday school kids were invited to take part in a **Mission Project**. Our goal was to bring in 50 items over the course of the month for local food pantries. We  **surpassed**  our goal and brought in 64 items. Thank you, Sunday school families, for your generosity!

Sunday school kids shared our **Christmas Pageant**  with our church family on Sunday, December 14 at 10am. This beloved annual tradition is a fun way to involve preschool through High School aged kids in the retelling of the Christmas story. Each year, a variety of children are able to participate. The pageant was followed by a birthday party for Jesus in the fellowship room.

**Sunday school**  will  **resume**  on  **January 4, 2026**  with an  **Intergenerational Sunday school class**  in the  **downstairs dining room.**  _Please bring a dish to pass if you are able._  We look forward to this time of learning and fellowship.

**Youth Club:**  During the month of December, our  **Youth Club** kids learned about the true meaning of Christmas and Advent during Bible time and Worship time. We also made placemats for Senior Companions and Advent wreaths during recreation time. We were able to share Christmas joy on December 10th, and go caroling at Elm Manor.  **Youth Club**  will  **take a break**  for Christmas and New Year’s, and we will  **meet again on January 7, 2026**.

Youth Club kids will  **invite friends**  to join them for one night of  **Youth Club**  on  **January 21, 2026**. Each year, we invite friends to join us for one night. It is exciting to share the fun we have at Youth Club with our friends – and usually some of them decide to join Youth Club for the rest of the year!

**VBS: Save the dates**!

**Rainforest Falls VBS:**  _Exploring the Nature of God_. Beneath a canopy of chattering birds and howling monkeys, kids plunge into a lifelong adventure of discovering the nature of God. They’ll explore what it means to be rooted in relationship with God, their creator, a safe place in life’s storms.  **July 13-17, 2026, 9am – 12noon**; Kick-off: Sun., July 12, 2026 at 6:30pm. All children,  **ages 4 years old through those who completed 5th grade**, are welcome to participate! Kids who completed 6th – 12th grade are  _encouraged to volunteer_!
