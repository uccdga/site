**Marilynn F. Nov 10**  
Marilynn is a retired High School English Teacher. She lives at The Terraces in Newark, a lovely senior home near her nephew. As a member of our congregation she was a faithful choir member, a women's circle member and a Bible study leader. In retirement she learned to knit and made prayer shawls for church members and friends. Marilynn always loved cats, welcoming strays and cared for many with love and patience. She will be celebrating her 94th birthday on November 10th. She no longer is able to attend worship, but welcomes visitors. -_Written by her Steward Rachel R._

**Hiram B. Nov 11**  
This month we celebrate  **Hiram!**  
A few fun facts about him: his favorite hymn is  _The Old Rugged Cross_  and his favorite scripture is  _Psalm 23_. One of his favorite childhood memories is building tunnels through the snowdrifts. Fall is his favorite season--the colors and hunting season make it extra special. Hiram and his wife,  **Linda**, spend this time of year in Mississippi visiting loved ones. We hope you have a great day, Hiram!

**Kurt W. Nov 14**  
Kurt is one of our "Senior Companions" and will be celebrating his 83rd birthday this month (as well as 59 years of marriage with Linda!). Kurt is a veteran of the U. S. Air Force and we thank him for his service along with our other veterans whom we honor this month on Veteran's Day. Please wish our friend Kurt well on his special day and may God continue to bless Kurt and Linda on their journey together. -_Written by his Steward Dan F._

**Ruth B. Nov 18**  
Ruth will be 94 this year. She joined the United Church in April 1943. She spent her childhood in Bloomfield with 5 siblings. Due to health reasons Ruth doesn't attend church regularly anymore, but is able to enjoy special events at church on occasion. I'm sure many of you know some of her family: Jim and Nancy (son-in-law and daughter); Mark and Lauren (grandson-in-law and granddaughter), Carter (great grandson). Ruth resides with Jim and Nancy. I'm sure she would enjoy receiving birthday wishes.  _Written by her Steward Bev F._
