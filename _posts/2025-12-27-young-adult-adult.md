**Sunday Morning Small Groups**  - After the Christmas break, we resume our normal Sunday school offerings. As a reminder, we have the  **parenting group***, which will spend time on "The Art of Parenting" curriculum from Family Life. The  **group designated for choir members**  will finish their "Case for Christmas" curriculum. The  **Bible study group**  continues on their journey through James. Finally, our  **young-adult group**  continues through a deep-dive into select passages of Romans.

**Mid-Week Connects**  - Our Ferris Hills group has been meeting monthly (though will not meet in January), which includes worship and a devotional. The Quail Summit group has started to meet, which has involved fellowship and snacks!

**Adult Ministry Bible Studies**  - Start your year off right by getting involved in our various mid-week Bible Studies! As a reminder, we have a men's group that meets every Wednesday morning at 7am at the church for breakfast, fellowship, Bible study, and prayer. We also have a group of women that meet every Thursday at 1pm at the church - also a Bible study.
