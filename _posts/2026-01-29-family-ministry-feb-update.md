**Youth Club**

On  **January 21st**, the  **Youth Club**  kids were able to  **invite one friend**  to join them at Youth Club**.** We had many friends come and see all the fun we have each week ~ we had a snow festival! We invite these friends to continue coming to Youth Club for the rest of the year, and each year we usually have a few friends who decide to do that! We are so blessed to be able to continue to share this valuable ministry with so many children and their families.

On February 25, the Youth Club kids will be filling  **“birthday bags.”**  These bags are filled with  **cake mix, frosting, birthday candles, balloons,**  and  **birthday napkins**. The bags are decorated and filled by our Youth Club kids and then given to local food pantries for families who are celebrating a birthday. You can help by  **donating**  the aforementioned items  **by Feb 22nd**. There is a collection box in Deb Marshall’s office.

**Sunday school**

Sunday school resumed on  **January 4, 2026**  with an  **intergenerational**  Sunday school class focused on the theme of  **comfort**. This is part of a series on  **Compassion**  that we began in our first Intergenerational Sunday school class in October. So far, we’ve worked through 3 sessions titled: “Come to Me,” “A Cup of Cold Water,” and “The One Who Comforts Us.” Each session combines discussion, activities, scripture reading, reflection, and prayer. We have one more  **Intergenerational Sunday School class**  on  **March 29, 2026**  at  **9:45am**  in the  **Downstairs Dining Room**. We will be working through the last session of this series called “Having Compassion,” and we hope to see you there!

Each Sunday, we offer S**unday school classes for all ages**. We have classes upstairs for 3-year-olds all the way through seniors in High School. We also offer a variety of classes for adults, including Parenting Coffee Hour, a Young Adult group, a Bible Study (currently focused on James), and a Choir group (ends early for choir members to get to practice before the 11am service). All Sunday school classes are “come when you can” style, so please join us when your schedule allows! Nursery care is provided so that parents of young children can either teach a class or attend a class of their choice.

**Lent**

The season of  **Lent**  begins on  **Ash Wednesday**, which is  **February 18th**  this year. All children who attend Sunday school will be given an age appropriate  **Lent devotional**  and older students will be encouraged to take one. We work hard at picking out Lent devotionals each year, and we hope these help children and families spend time  **growing closer to God**  and one another during this special church season.

**Mark your calendar…**
