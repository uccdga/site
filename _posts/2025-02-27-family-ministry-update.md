What’s happened…

We invited friends to Youth Club on February 12 since our original date for Bring a Friend night was canceled due to a snow day.  We had 19 friends join the regular group of 60 kids who come to Youth Club. What a joy to share the love of Jesus with so many children! In late February and early March, the Youth Club children will decorate and fill Birthday Bags. (The birthday bag assembly also got moved due to the snow day). These bags are given to families in need who use our local food pantries and have a child in their family who is celebrating a birthday. Thank you to all who donated to this service project!

Sunday school and Youth Club kids received age-appropriate Lenten devotionals.  It is our hope that providing these devotionals to children and youth will give them an opportunity to grow closer to our Lord and Savior Jesus. It is also a special time that families can engage in faith conversations at home. Parents are encouraged to set aside daily time to use the devotionals together. Please join me in praying for our families as they engage in faith conversations through this Lenten season!

What’s happening…

On March 19th, the Youth Club kids will go ice skating at the Greater Canandaigua Civic Center. After we arrive at church and have a snack, we will divide up into cars and head over to the ice skating rink. We will skate for about an hour and then have pizza and soda. Parents, please note, pick up your children early at 5:30pm at the Greater Canandaigua Civic Center. 

On March 23, Sunday school children and youth will be given Rice Bowls. These bowls are filled with loose change or bills to help feed children in orphanages all over the world. We appreciate the support of this special Lenten offering!

On March 30, Sunday school children will invite their school teachers to join us for the 11am worship service. We will recognize our special guests during the service and have a cookie and punch reception for families and their teacher guests following the service. We look forward to honoring teachers on this special Sunday! Article body in Markdown (Twist will format it for you)
