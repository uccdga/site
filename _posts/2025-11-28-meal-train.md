The Meal Train Team recently gathered for a delightful time of fellowship hosted by our team coordinator,  **Louise VanIseghem**. Louise welcomed everyone with her delicious homemade pies--baked completely from scratch--and the group enjoyed an afternoon filled with laughter and connection.

Everyone enjoyed the chance to connect and share conversation around the table, and several volunteers had the joy of meeting one another for the first time. This gathering was part of our ongoing  **Care Ministry initiative**  to help team members build deeper relationships and foster a greater sense of community among those who serve within Care Ministry.

A heartfelt  **thank you to Louise**  for opening her home and creating such a warm and meaningful time together!
