We're delighted to welcome  **Doris G.**  and  **Shirley B.**  as the newest members of our Senior Companion Circle: a ministry that celebrates those who have reached a special season of life, marked by wisdom, faith, and grace.

Our  **Board of Stewards**  and Senior Companions share a bond of faith and friendship, walking together in mutual care and encouragement.

We are grateful to have Doris and Shirley in our circle and look forward to spending time together and getting to know these ladies better.
