Our  **Friends & Fellowship Fall Event**  for those 85 and up began with a short worship service and Communion in the sanctuary, a meaningful time of praise and reflection together. We were especially grateful to Pastor Wade for sharing in this time of worship and leading us in Communion.

Afterward, everyone gathered in the dining hall to enjoy games, pumpkin decorating, and what we jokingly called a "light lunch" (though it was anything but light!). The afternoon was filled with laughter, conversation, and joy as friends reconnected and new memories were made.

A heartfelt thank-you to our Stewards for their thoughtful planning, preparation, and warm hospitality. Their care and cheerful service made the day especially memorable.

Events like this remind us of the blessing of shared fellowship and the beauty of caring for one another across generations.
