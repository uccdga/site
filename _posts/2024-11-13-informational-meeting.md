Dear Church Family,

We are excited to invite you to a special meeting during the Sunday School hour (9:45-10:45 AM) on Sunday, January 12, where the Boyce Discernment Team will present their work on discerning the best uses for a significant donation generously given to The United Church in the fall of 2023. This gift presents a wonderful opportunity for ministry growth, and the discernment team has been prayerfully considering how we can honor the spirit of this gift while meeting the needs of our church and community.

During the meeting, members of the Boyce Discernment Team will share their findings and insights, providing a glimpse into the process they've undertaken to thoughtfully evaluate potential uses for the donation. Most importantly, this session will be an opportunity for you, the congregation, to share your own perspectives and feedback. We value your voice, as each member’s insight is crucial in shaping how this gift can impact our community for years to come.

Please mark your calendars for this meaningful time of listening, learning, and sharing together. We hope you will join us to engage with the discernment process, lend your voice, and help us steward this gift with faith and vision.
