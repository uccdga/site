## Youth Club Update and Service Project:

Our **Youth Club** numbers have grown. We invited friends to Youth Club in February and now we have **64 children** enrolled in Youth Club. What a joy to share the love of Jesus with so many children each week! On **March 5**, the Youth Club children filled **45 Birthday Bags**. These bags are given to families in need who use our **local food pantries** and have someone celebrating a birthday. _Thank you to all who donated to this service project!_

**April** is the last month of Youth Club, and we have some special plans! We will have **1st graders visit Youth Club on April 23rd** so that they know what to expect when they can begin attending in the fall of 2025. Also on April 23rd, our middle school kids get one last "dinner out" at Tom Wahl's. And our **last Youth Club, on April 30th**, will include our annual carnival and a special dinner that includes all Youth Club volunteers and the Youth Club kids with their families! We look forward to lots of fun and continued deepening of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Summer Faith Growing Opportunities:

On Sunday, **April 27**, we will have **Camp Day**! Representatives from a few camps will join us and share with kids about their camps (during the Sunday school hour). After the 11am service, these camp reps will be in the welcome center and available to answer questions. If you are curious about camp, please make sure to join us on this special Sunday! And, don't forget about **camperships**!! Our church believes that the Christian camp experience is so important that **we will pay Â½ the tuition for one week at any Christian day camp or overnight camp**! This is not a need based scholarship -- this is for every family sending a child to Christian camp this summer! The only qualification is that your child currently participates in Sunday School, Youth Club, and/or The Cause. **Parents,** _please note:_ **Beaver Camp** gives us **discount codes** for **camperships**. BEFORE you register your child for Beaver Camp, please contact Deb for the discount code. For LeTourneau and other Christian camps, our process remains the same, once you're signed up, send the registration confirmation to Deb, and we will take care of the campership. Please contact Deb Marshall with any questions.
