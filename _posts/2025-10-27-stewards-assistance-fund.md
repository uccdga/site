Each November, as part of our Sunday offering, we receive donations for the Stewards Assistance Fund. Any loose change given during this first Sunday of November is also directed toward the fund. These gifts provide confidential support to those in our church family facing unexpected needs, allowing us to extend Christ's love in practical ways. Thank you to those who have contributed!
