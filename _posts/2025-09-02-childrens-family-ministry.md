**Summer Camp:**  This summer,  **34**  children from our church were sent to Christian camps with your help from our campership fund. **Our mission budget provides ½ the cost for one week at a Christian camp for any child that attends Sunday School, Youth Club, and/or The Cause.** This can make a huge difference for parents who otherwise may have to decide between sending only one of several children to camp, or no one at all. With all the different choices available for kids, we are so glad to encourage them with a lasting experience, one that will strengthen their relationship with Jesus Christ….one that has  _eternal_  benefits! **Thank you for your support!**

**Nursery needs volunteers**: Nursery Care for  **infants through preschoolers**  is provided every Sunday. The nursery is staffed with volunteers during both Worship services and during the Sunday School hour.  **We need MORE nursery volunteers to help care for our littlest ones.**  We can use adults and kids aged 7th grade and up. Please contact Louise Van Iseghem or Deb Marshall if you are interested in volunteering for the nursery.  _Please note that all people 18 and over who volunteer in the nursery need to be background checked_  – this is a quick and easy process! Contact Carolyn to be checked.

**True North VBS**:  **trusting Jesus in a Wild World!**  The week of July 14-18 was a valuable week in the Kingdom of God as 56 children (38 from our church, 18 from the community) learned that Jesus is a faithful friend we can always trust! The daily Bible points taught kids that when we wonder, when we feel alone, when we feel powerless, when we need hope, and when we need help…we can trust Jesus! Kids were guided on an ultimate Alaskan adventure and as they trekked the tundra, kids discovered how easy it is to lose sight of what’s true in our wild world today. Pointing them toward Jesus, our week of VBS showed kids that  **He is our True North!**  Children learned about the daily Bible point and Bible stories through drama, songs, games, science experiments, videos and crafts. God faithfully provided 55 adults, teens, and tweens who served as crew leaders, station leaders, snack preparers, station helpers, crew helpers, nursery caregivers, and photographers.  **Thank you also to ALL who supported us with generous donations, prayers, scenery help, set up, and clean up! We appreciate each of you!**  Our VBS mission project, Operation Kid to Kid, raised $310.70 for warm clothes and blankets for kids living in North America. What a generous bunch of VBS families!  **That’s a God sighting!**

_“To Him who is able to do exceedingly, abundantly_
_above all we can think or ask,_
_according to His power that is at work within us,_
_to Him be the glory in the church_
_and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations,_
_for ever and ever! Amen!”_

Ephesians 3:20-21
