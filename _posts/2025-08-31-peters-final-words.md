What would you say if you knew you only had a few weeks left to live? The apostle Peter faced exactly this situation when he wrote his second letter to the early church. Knowing his execution under Emperor Nero was approaching, Peter penned what would become his farewell message, and it's extremely relevant for us today.

This September, we'll begin our journey through 2 Peter. This short letter has much to say. Peter addresses challenges that sound surprisingly like 2025. He deals with teachers twisting God's truth for personal gain, leaders living corrupt lifestyles, and people questioning whether Jesus will really return. These weren't just first-century problems; they're issues we still face today.

Throughout this series, we will learn that God has given us everything necessary for godly living. Rather than leaving us to figure things out on our own, Peter provides a roadmap for spiritual growth through what he calls God's "great and precious promises." We'll examine his eight-step ladder for spiritual development and discover why he believed we all need regular reminders of central truths.

Peter wrote with the heart of a pastor who deeply loved his people. Using vivid imagery like temporary tents and stirring up dying fires, he expresses his urgency to encourage believers while he still can. His letter defends the reliability of Scripture in an age when people questioned apostolic authority, offering solid ground for faith when competing voices create confusion.

What makes this letter especially powerful is Peter's own story of transformation. This is the same man who once denied Jesus three times. Yet he became the rock-solid leader of the early church. His words carry the weight of someone who learned from failure, experienced grace, and wants to strengthen others facing similar challenges.

Peter's second letter isn't long, but it's packed with wisdom for godly living. He addresses real-world challenges with biblical solutions, offering both encouragement and necessary warnings. Whether you're new to faith or have been following Jesus for years, Peter's final words have something valuable to offer.

**Here's an invitation:** Consider reading ahead each week to get the most from this series. The entire letter is only three chapters, making it manageable to read through multiple times during September. Peter wrote with urgency because he knew his time was short. While we may not face his immediate circumstances, his passion for spiritual growth and biblical truth speaks directly to our lives today.

This September, let's explore together what it means to grow spiritually, stay grounded in truth, and live with hope in Christ's return. Peter's farewell message reminds us that the Christian life is both a gift to receive and a calling to pursue with intentionality.

_Join us starting September 7th for this encouraging series on 2 Peter. Come ready to be both comforted and challenged by the final words of one who walked with Jesus._
