This December, help spread the joy of the season by sending Christmas cards to those in our church family who would be especially blessed by a thoughtful note - those living at home or in care communities.

Cards provided by the Stewards' Ministry, along with address lists, are available in the  **Outreach Room**. Simply pick up a few, write a cheerful message, and mail your greetings.
