_Shared by Those We’ve Served_

**Thank you Steward Friends**

_“Thank you for many special cards and messages of encouragement that you sent me. I am blessed and enjoy each note. I am happy when I am able to see friends at church, or a visit.  
The Friends and Fellowship luncheon was great - wonderful food and fun. Marion, hugs to you. Good wishes to all. Thanks Christy and the Care Ministry.”  
Joy and Blessings,  
Shirley_

**Dear Care Team,**  
_"This is a huge "thank you" for sending Louise and Kevin over to help me remove the tarp from my pergola. They did a wonderful job in record time! You guys are doing a great service to those who are in need of help now and then." God bless you! Susan G._
