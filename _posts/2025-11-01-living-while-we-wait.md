Do you remember waiting for Christmas morning as a child? I had an Advent calendar with a piece of candy on each day, counting down to Christmas. The anticipation was exciting but also agonizing. My parents weren't being cruel by making me wait. They knew Christmas would come at just the right time, and no amount of begging would change it.

This November, as we conclude our journey through 2 Peter and enter the Advent season, we'll discover that our waiting for Jesus' return is similar to waiting for Christmas.

In 2 Peter 3, Peter addresses a question that still challenges us today:  _If Jesus is really coming back, why is it taking so long?_  False teachers in the early church were using this delay to mock the Christian faith. They claimed that since Jesus hadn't returned yet, He never would.

Peter's response reveals God's character. The delay isn't because God is slow or has forgotten His promise. From God's perspective the timing is perfect. We are reminded that a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like a day for God. And the delay actually reveals God's patient love for humanity. Every day that Jesus doesn't return is another day for someone to be saved, another opportunity for people to turn to Him.

Another dynamic is how we live until Jesus comes back. Peter urges us to live holy and godly lives, actively working to "speed" Christ's coming through evangelism, prayer, and obedience. We should invest in what will last forever rather than temporary things. So, while we are waiting, we should make every effort to be found spotless, blameless, and at peace with Him when He returns.

As we conclude our study in 2 Peter, this topic serves as a wonderful bridge to Advent. On the last Sunday of November, we step into Advent, exploring Psalm 122. The ancient pilgrims singing their way to Jerusalem capture what it means to wait with anticipation. They rejoiced at the invitation to worship. They longed for God's presence. They prayed for peace and committed to work for the good of God's people.

Like those pilgrims, we're on a journey toward home. Our feet may be standing in today's circumstances, but our hearts long for God's Kingdom. We're not killing time until Jesus returns. We're actively preparing, praying, and living for His Kingdom. We're anticipating the day when our waiting will be over and we'll stand in the gates of God's eternal city.

The question isn't  _when_  Jesus is coming back. The question is:  _How are we living because He is coming back?_  This November, let's live as people who truly believe the promise, who work actively for His Kingdom, and who long with joyful anticipation for our King to come.

Come, Lord Jesus, come.
