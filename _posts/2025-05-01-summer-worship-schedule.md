Beginning May 25, we will transition to our summer worship schedule with one unified service at 9:30 AM. This schedule will remain in place through Labor Day weekend.

Our summer schedule provides us with a wonderful opportunity to worship together as one congregation. During these months, we'll continue our journey through the Psalms as we gather in a single morning service. This unified summer worship creates space for our church family to strengthen connections across generations. It's a reminder that we remain one body in Christ, seeking to approach God with our whole hearts.

Please make note of this schedule change and share the information with others who might be planning to visit our church during the summer months.
