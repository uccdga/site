A couple Lamplighters ago, I reflected on the ordinary and extraordinary nature of corporate worship. The sacred and secular elements of our Sunday morning gatherings belong together, as they engage the fullness of God's design.

This month, I continue to reflect on corporate worship, specifically my approach to creating a sermon. As an inexperienced pastor whose primary focus is youth, young adult, and adult ministry programs here at The United Church, my sermon writing process is admittedly half-baked and hardly seasoned.

Currently, I am self-reflecting on my heart posture towards sermon creation, and the need to be humbled and maintain that humility during the process. Below I have structured my reflection with the heart posture at the beginning of each short paragraph (boldened), followed by a heart-felt response.

**Who am I to speak before the Lord speaks to me?** In the opening verses of the Scriptures, God speaks, and creation responds. I must respond the same. This means I need to open my heart and ears to listen to/for the word of God, because He speaks to me (and all of us). I pray my response - every time - is "Here I Am, Lord" (and of course, with a corresponding pure and obedient heart). I must respond!

**Who am I to speak to others before I speak with God?** God speaks to me through His Word, through the Spirit, and through His creation. I must respond to God in prayer. I must make the inspired Psalms my own. The Psalmist who wrote Ps. 96 articulates how all of creation praises the Lord. I must join the fields, the trees, and the sea in praise! In times of despair, I must lament and cry out to the Lord using Psalm 22:1, just as Jesus the Christ had done. I must pray!

**Who am I to open my mouth before I listen to those who have preached the word before me?** I must learn from the wisdom and teachings of the early church fathers, whether it be St. Augustine or St. Basil the Great. I must consider the pleas and protests of my ancestors of the reformation, including Luther, our presbyterian forefather John Calvin, and even (I dare say!) the Council of Trent. Even today - I must carefully listen to the great NT Wright and Tim Keller. I must listen to Pastor Wade and the archived sermons of Dr. Doug Cullum. I must listen!

**Who am I to produce my own words about Scripture without engaging the community God has given me?** What does my wife think? What does my child think? What does my church family think (whether it be fellow staff, the worship planning team, elders, and others)? Who have I included into my sermon process? In Acts, the church leaders demonstrated communal discernment. I must communally discern!

**Who am I?** A young minister in need of God's words in my life, and a humility to hear and learn from others before me and with me. I pray that a humble posture takes root in my life as the Lord speaks to me and through me.
