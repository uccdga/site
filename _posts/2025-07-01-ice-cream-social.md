### **Tuesday, July 29 at 6:30-8:00 p.m.**

**We're bringing all the Helping Hands Teams together and hope you can join us!** All members of the Transportation Team, Hospitality Team, Meal Train Team, Support Team, and our Care Ministers, are invited to a summer **Ice Cream Social** on **Tuesday, July 29 at 6:30 p.m.**

This will be a fun and relaxed time to get to know others who are stepping into these new ministries, meet your team coordinators, and connect across teams. It's a wonderful way to see how each part of the Helping Hands Ministry fits together to serve our church family with care and compassion.

More details to comeâ€¦ but for now, save the date and get ready to enjoy some ice cream and good company!
