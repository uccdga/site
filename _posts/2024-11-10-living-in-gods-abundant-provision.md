This sermon reflects on the closing scene of Genesis, focusing on the deaths of Jacob and Joseph and the continuation of God's promise to their descendants. Despite their deaths, the story of God’s deliverance and grace is not over, as Joseph expresses hope for the future return to the Promised Land. The sermon highlights that the story of Genesis is only the beginning, with God’s ultimate plan for redemption unfolding through the work of Jesus.
