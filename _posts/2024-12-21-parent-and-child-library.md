The Parent/Child Library in the upstairs chapel has been refreshed with LOTS of new books! You may borrow a book off either the display shelf or the regular book shelf. All families are welcome to use the Parent/Child library at any time. Please sign the book(s) out and return within 4 weeks. Any questions? See Deb Marshall.
