#### Personal Reflection - Prayers in May

The month of May is one of my favorite months of the year. While it often starts out cold, and possibly could even still feel a bit wintry on some days, it typically ends warm. There have been many Memorial Day weekends that I can remember wearing shorts - or, at the very least, jeans and a t-shirt with no jacket! And, I LOVE warm weather. 

In addition to warmer temperatures, May also brings new life in many ways - baby animals are born, flower gardens have some early spring flowers, the grass is green and growing, trees are becoming full of leaves, etc. This, in addition to the sunshine and warmer weather, is sure to put a spring in my step! (No pun intended). 

Another great part about May is that on Memorial Day weekend, we begin meeting together for one service of worship. This is an exciting time because it gives us the opportunity to fellowship with some of our church family that we may not normally see. 

May also brings an end to our Sunday school year. While this is bittersweet, it is a welcome change after a busy year of ministry. With the slower pace of ministry this month, I have extra time to devote to prayer. Each day, I pray for different aspects of family ministry.  Will you join me in prayer this month? Here is the general guide I will use:
