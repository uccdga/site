The sermon explores the biblical concept of gratitude as we approach Thanksgiving. Reflecting on Psalm 107 and the story of the ten lepers in Luke 17, the message emphasizes the importance of giving thanks for God’s unfailing love and wonderful deeds. In the story of the healed leper who returned to give thanks, the connection between a thankful heart and spiritual healing is highlighted. The call is to live in a posture of gratitude, recognizing both God’s enduring love and His acts of rescue in our lives.
