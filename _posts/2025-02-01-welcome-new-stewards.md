_"Guided by our love for the Lord and a deep commitment to serving others, the Board of Stewards seeks to extend God's love through acts of humility, kindness, compassion, and faithfulness. Our mission is to provide companionship, support, and care to our church family members aged 90 and above, as well as those in long-term care. Through personal visits and meaningful engagement, we strive to create a community of love and support where everyone feels valued and connected."_

The Board of Stewards is a dedicated and well-equipped team, trained to care for the aging with sensitivity and grace. It is a privilege to work alongside this Christ-centered group as they serve the Lord by serving others.

I am delighted to introduce our 2025 Board of Stewards. Returning to continue their faithful service are Bev, Bill, Dan, Martha, Marion, Phil, Rachel, Sharyn and Wanda. We are also thrilled to welcome Beth, Gail, and Diane to our team. Their energy and commitment will be a blessing to this ministry.

Please join me in praying for this team as they build meaningful relationships and provide support to their Senior Companions. May God guide their efforts and bless their ministry abundantly.
