While recovering from a stroke earlier this year, Lou received the exciting news that he had been selected as  **a candidate for induction into the Sayville High School Athlete Hall of Fame, Class of 2025.**

During his high school years on Long Island, Lou excelled in both football and baseball, earning varsity letters in each. He was named to the All-County football team as a freshman and received the Marinus Buys Trophy in baseball for his .433 batting average his senior year.

In September, Lou and Carolyn traveled to Long Island with their family to attend the induction ceremony and celebrate their  **66th wedding anniversary.**  They were joyfully surprised by longtime friends from Tennessee and even reunited with a cousin they hadn't seen in 30 years. The weekend was filled with laughter, delicious seafood, and heartfelt memories as they visited favorite restaurants, their childhood homes, and the church where they were married.

**God is so faithful!**
