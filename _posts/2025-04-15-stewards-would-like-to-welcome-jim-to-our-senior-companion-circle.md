We're delighted to welcome Jim H. as the newest member of our Senior Companion Circle--a ministry of presence and care for those who are 90 and above or living with ongoing health challenges. Through regular visits, phone calls, cards, and compassionate connection, our Board of Stewards walks alongside these cherished members, offering friendship and spiritual encouragement.

Jim brings a love for music--he plays piano for church services at his senior living community and has always enjoyed singing, especially in the church choir. He is a man of deep faith who finds joy in Bible study, sharing the gospel, and time spent outdoors, especially on the golf course. An alumnus of Hamilton College and a retired computer programmer, Jim spent most of his life in the Philadelphia area before moving to Victor to be closer to family. Though he no longer has a dog, he remains a devoted dog lover.

We are grateful to have Jim in our circle and look forward to spending time together and getting to know him better. Please keep Jim--and all members of our Senior Companion Circle--in your prayers.
