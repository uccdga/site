**Happy Birthday Helen S.!**
Our dear friend, Helen, will be celebrating her 93rd birthday on July 16th. She has many fond memories of growing up on a farm in Daleville, Indiana. Helen and her sister drove the tractor to help her father with the crops, helped her mother sell the eggs their hens produced, and joyfully rode a makeshift swing down from the haymow. She met her husband Don when she was in the 7th grade and, by the time she was a senior in high school, Helen wore an engagement ring on her finger.

During the Korean War, she and Don moved with the Navy from Charleston to Norfolk to Puerto Rico and back to Indiana -- welcoming 3 babies along the way. They were married 54 years. Helen loves to sew and create custom articles such as costumes for Sunday School performances. In fact, she created Joseph's Coat of Many Colors, which has been used several times over the years by the children in our church. Helen finds joy in thanking God for every "little" thing that happens in her life; saying, "We are never alone. Good things that happen to us are not luck -- it's all God!" Happy birthday, Helen!

**Happy Birthday Jim P.!**

**Happy Birthday Larry H.!**
Senior Companion Larry H is having a birthday this summer on July 31. Larry moved to Clark Meadows this year and has adjusted well to his new home.

**Happy Birthday Sandy C.!**
Sandy C. is celebrating a birthday in August . Sandy spends much of her time reading her devotionals and studying her Bible.

She has wonderful memories of spending summers on her Uncle's farm on Lake Ontario with her brothers, picking cherries, and enjoying the chickens, dairy cows, pigs and playing in the barns. Years later, she and her husband would take their family to the farm for camping and outdoor fun. Sandy developed a love for antiques from her Mom and Grandma. Later she and her husband would run an antique business and refinish furniture. Her favorite wood is tiger maple.
