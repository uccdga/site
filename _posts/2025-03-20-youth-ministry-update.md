**North Carolina Missions Trip** (Apr 13-18) - Our **youth** are included in an important mission trip to serve those in need down in North Carolina. Check out the Missions Page for details. **Please keep our group in your prayers!**

**Summer Outlook** - Save the dates for our annual **Youth Summer Retreat** (6th-12th grade; August 16, 9a-9p) and **Summer Mission Experiences** (6-12 grade, August 18-22). More details to come as events get closer.

**The Cause (High School Youth Group)** - We are wrapping up our curriculum titled "**Can I Ask That? Hard Questions about God and Faith**". We've spent over 1.5 years using this content, and it has generated valuable conversation with our students. Moving forward, we are focusing on the Easter season and end-of-year discussions and activities (8th grade orientation, senior night, end-of-year reflections and celebrations, etc.).
