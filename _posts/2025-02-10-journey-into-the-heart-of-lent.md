Lent *invites* us into a journey that mirrors Christ's own path. As we enter this season of reflection, our Scripture readings *illuminate* a narrative that moves from the Father affirming the Son through wilderness testing to the ultimate expression of God's love.

We begin on the mountain of Transfiguration, where God's glory *breaks through* the veil of ordinary existence. This revelation *serves* not merely as a spectacular display but as essential preparation for the valley that follows. The radiance of Christ's transformed presence *offers* us the same strength it provided the disciples as they faced the challenges ahead.

The wilderness is next, where we *witness* Jesus's confrontation with temptation. Here emerges a profound truth: even the incarnate Word relies on the written Word. This testing *reveals* how Scripture becomes our sustenance in desolate places. What might this tell us about our own moments of spiritual testing?

The journey then leads us through the reality of God's love met with human resistance. Jesus's lament over Jerusalem *opens* a window into God's heart – persistent love continuing even in the face of rejection. This narrative *challenges* our understanding of both God's patience and human response.

When we *encounter* the questions of tragedy and suffering, Jesus's teaching through the fig tree parable *offers* unexpected insights. 

The journey culminates in three interconnected parables of losing and finding. These narratives *reveal* the relentless nature of God's love – a love that actively seeks what is lost until it is found. Through these stories, we *discover* that Lent isn't about our search for God, but rather about allowing ourselves to be found by the One who never stops searching.

This Lenten path *invites* us into a deeper understanding of how God transforms our wanderings into experiences of grace. Each text *offers* fresh insights into God's redemptive work. What might we learn as we journey through these ancient words that still speak with living power?
