This summer, we’re inviting you to join a simple act of care that can have a big impact: **sending a card to one of our Senior Companions**, beloved members of our church who are age 90+ or living with ongoing health concerns.

A few thoughtful words can bring light and encouragement to someone’s day. Whether it’s a favorite Scripture, a prayer, or just a note to say “you’re in my thoughts,” your card will be a reminder that they are seen, loved, and not forgotten.

**Stop by the Outreach Room (Mark’s old office)** to pick up cards and addresses.
