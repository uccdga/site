# Reflections on Youth and Adult Ministry: December 2024

## **Youth Ministry Updates**

This season, our youth ministry has been diving deep into questions of faith and exploring the heart of God through thoughtful curriculums and meaningful activities.

### **Curriculum Highlights**
- **The Cause:** Utilizing *"Can I Ask That? Hard Questions about God and Faith,"* we've tackled challenging topics like doubt, forgiveness, and the reality of hell. Our students are engaging these discussions with depth and respect.
- **Sunday School & Youth Club:** Both middle and high school groups are learning through *Deep Discipleship.* Covering themes such as the habits of Jesus, navigating fear, and apologetics, this curriculum resonates across Sunday School and Youth Club, offering layered and rich discussions.

### **Seasonal Events**
- **Christmas Mall Trip:** A cherished tradition, where high school students mentor middle schoolers during a trip to the mall to buy gifts for loved ones. This event is always a highlight for our students!
- **Operation Christmas Child:** The high school group is donating toys to children in poverty across the globe, embodying the spirit of giving this season.

### **Regular Gatherings**
- **Monthly School District Connects:** Our ongoing district connections in Victor, Canandaigua, and Marcus Whitman provide students with opportunities for fellowship and encouragement.

### **Youth Ministry Team**
Our dedicated team continues to meet every other month to shape and support these ministries. Special thanks to Julie Zajac, Dale Zajac, Lauren Slomski, Kayleigh Sheppard, Ray McMillen, Sandi DiCicco, Jen Callard, and Jini Hildebrandt for their commitment and leadership.

## **Pastoral Ministry Reflection**

As Advent begins, it’s a time to recalibrate our priorities and remember the reality of Jesus’ first coming. This reflection is part one of a series on the mission of the Church in a post-Christian culture.

### **Proclamation (Belief)**
A cornerstone of the church's mission is proclamation—a public declaration of Christian belief. This involves rediscovering the rich traditions of proclamation from:
1. **Scriptural Foundations:** The prophetic declarations of the Old Testament, the teachings of Jesus, and the apostolic preaching of the gospel.
2. **Historical Contexts:** Recognizing the Christian roots of many Western ideals, as noted by Dr. Christopher Watkins in *Biblical Critical Theory,* who described secularization as a "Christian history."
3. **Preaching Ministry:** Rediscovering the role of the Quheleth, or "assembler of the people into the presence of God," as noted by the late Eugene Peterson.

### **Looking Ahead**
This Advent season, may we boldly proclaim the Good News of Christ’s birth, life, and salvation. Let us remember John 3:16: *"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life."*
