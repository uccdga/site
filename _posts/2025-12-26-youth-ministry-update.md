**Sunday School** - Our  **Middle School**  and  **High School classes**  continue in early January, after the Christmas break. With pageant practice behind us, we are resuming our joint activity time at the beginning of the Sunday school hour. We pray this helps our students build stronger relationships across grade levels, and adds a bit of high-energy fun on a Sunday morning.

**High School Youth Group (The Cause)**  - Like much of the other programs, we are are starting back up in early January, after the Christmas break. We are still working through Romans, and conducted a "testimony night" in December. We also enjoyed a Christmas party mid-December (always a fun time with out energetic students!).

**Youth Club Middle School Group Bible Study**  - This class is following the same studies as the high school group. "Testimony day" was particularly impactful; several of them (including HS'ers Sunday night) made mention that this was the first time they sat down to write out their testimony. We pray this was a fruitful exercise for them!

**School District Connects**  - Our mid-week connects continue, with Victor, Marcus Whitman, and Canandaigua connects active. We hope to perform a homeschool connect this month, or next.

**Youth Mall Trip**  - While this article was written a few days before the mall trip, all signs point to another memorable middle school and high school Christmas event. This year, we scheduled the event on a Saturday, which takes advantage of being just after the Pageant practice, a longer window of time to enjoy the mall, and coupled with the church game night. With adults and students combined, we are hovering around 30 people involved.

**January Special Events**

-   **Youth Fun Night**  - Sunday, January 24, 6:30PM-10PM - 6-12 grade students are invited! Much of our time together will include fun and games, and a period of time to prep for the annual meeting fundraiser.
-   **Annual Meeting Fundraiser**  - January 25, after the 11AM service - 6-12 grade students and adults that are involved in youth missions & educational activities are asked to support. This year, we are conducting a "chili, soup, and salad" bar, with items donated via a sign-up during the Sunday's leading into the event. We believe this will help reduce the amount of people that miss Sunday service (in terms of prep time), and also increase the amount raised to support our ministry.
