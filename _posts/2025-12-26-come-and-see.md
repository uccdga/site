As we step into the new year, we find ourselves embarking on a journey together. We actually begin this journey on January 4, still in the season of Christmas, as we open John's Gospel with the words "In the beginning was the Word." Then on January 11, we enter the season of Epiphany, and from there through Pentecost Sunday in May, we'll remain in John's Gospel.

This isn't just a sermon series. It's an invitation to walk with Jesus through one of the most theologically rich books in Scripture. John doesn't just tell us what Jesus did. He shows us who Jesus is.

John wrote with a clear purpose:

> These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name (John 20:31).

As we study this Gospel, we are not just learning information about Jesus. We are challenged to be transformed through believing in him.

Over these months, we'll witness Jesus' first sign at the wedding in Cana, hear him tell Nicodemus he must be born again, watch him offer living water to a Samaritan woman, and listen as he declares "I am the bread of life," "I am the good shepherd," "I am the resurrection and the life." We'll walk through his final week, stand at the cross, run to the empty tomb, and meet him in locked rooms and by the sea.

I want to encourage you to do more than just show up on Sunday mornings. This article includes not only the John passage for each week but also a Psalm and an Epistle reading that connect thematically with John's message. These readings help us see the larger story and deepen our understanding.

Can I challenge you during this series? Read the passages before Sunday. Sit with them. Ask questions. Notice what stands out to you. When you come on Sunday already having wrestled with the text, you'll find the sermon connects differently. You'll hear things you might have missed. You'll be ready to go deeper.

Remember what Philip said to Nathanael when he was skeptical about Jesus? "Come and see." That's the invitation John extends through his gospel, and it's the invitation I extend to you for these coming months.

Come and see Jesus revealed in all his glory. Come and see what happens when the Word becomes flesh and dwells among us. Come and see how water becomes wine, how the blind receive sight, how the dead are raised.

This journey through John isn't just about learning more about Jesus. It's about encountering him, believing in him, and finding life in his name. I'm excited to take this journey with you.
