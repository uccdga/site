**Sunday Morning Small Groups**  - Our  **young adult/adult ministry**  has finished the 6-week small group Bible study initiative, following the 2 Peter sermon series. We ended the initiative with a large group reflection/survey. It appears most people appreciated the smaller group size. Moving forward, here are the current Sunday school offerings:

-   **Choir Group -**  Room 26 (2nd floor), ends by 10:25am. “Case for Christmas” Advent Study by Max Lucado
-   **Parenting Coffee Hour -**  Fellowship Room (1st floor). Focus on Advent.
-   **Bible Study - James**  - Downstairs Dining Hall. A 10-week study using a Max Lucado study book.
-   **“Dig Deeper” Young Adult Bible Study**  - Bell Tower (with occasional coffee shop outings!) - A deep study of selected passages in Romans (using the SOAP method).

**Mid-Week Connects**  - Our Ferris Hills group has been meeting monthly, which includes worship and a devotional. We are still looking to start our Quail Summit connect.

**Adult Ministry Bible Studies**  - Our church has a long-standing culture of mid-week Bible studies that include small to medium-sized groups of people in our church and community. For instance, we have a men's group that meets every Wednesday morning at 7am at the church for breakfast, fellowship, Bible study, and prayer. We also have a group of women that meet every Thursday at 1pm at the church - also a Bible study (see the picture of some of their members at a recent gathering!). These groups are open and can be joined anytime.

**Advent Books**  - Head over to the Welcome Center to see the Advent book offerings! We have a mixture of devotional and educational materials to consider.
