The role of a Steward often happens quietly, behind the scenes, but the impact is deeply felt. Whether visiting a senior companion, preparing for worship, or simply offering a listening ear, Stewards help build connection and care within our church family.

I recently asked three Stewards to share a favorite part of their role. Here’s what they had to say:

**Bill F.**:

“My favorite part of being a Steward is hearing people I visit tell their story. I love letting them describe important things in their lives and see that I appreciate the wonderful people they are.”

**Bev F.**:

“One of the responsibilities I enjoy about being a Steward is visiting my senior companion. When I arrive their whole face lights up with a smile.  I think they are genuinely happy to think someone wants to keep them connected to their church family.”

**Gail B.**:

“I've only been on Stewards for a couple of months, but I love how the group feels like a family and I feel a part of them already. ♥️ I was a little amazed at all that they do...lots of quiet, behind-the-scenes stuff. (For example, I never thought about who sets up our Communion service each month... it's a labor of love done by the Stewards.) And I especially love the connections we make with our church's senior companions. God's love is certainly pulsating in the heart of every steward.”
