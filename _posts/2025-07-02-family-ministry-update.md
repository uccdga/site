**Communicants Class:** This past late winter/early spring, 6 youth (Adele, Elise, Jackson, Leah, Lily, and Mason) went through Communicants class with Pastor Wade.  On May 18, this important faith milestone was celebrated. Some kids chose to be baptized for the first time, some reaffirmed their infant baptism, some joined the church, and some decided to wait until later to be baptized or join the church. No matter what decision each student made, one thing was clear - they grew in their faith and knowledge of God and we pray that their experience will draw them ever closer to their Savior, Jesus Christ. 

**Summer Camp**: Please keep our **campers** in prayer as they head to Christian camp this summer. We **pray their hearts will be open** to all God has for them while they are at camp. Keep the list below somewhere handy so that you can **pray for our campers all summer long**!

**Want to connect with a camper?** We have **“camp notes”** available in the Ministry Outreach Center (Mark’s old office) **for every camper**. There are LOTS of notes because we are sending a note for every camp the kids are attending!!! Inside every specially made card, there is a note describing the camper and a note telling when the camp note needs to be mailed to arrive on time.  **If you are interested/willing to write a note to a camper, please pick up a card.** They are addressed and stamped, so all you need to do is write a note and send it at the correct time. Any questions? Please contact Deb Marshall. 

**Nursery**: Our **nursery** is **open** during **summer worship services.** Please consider **volunteering in the nursery,** as this gives parents of the youngest in our church family time to truly **connect with God.** You can sign up in the Services app or by letting Louise Van Iseghem or Deb Marshall know you are interested. We need 2 nursery volunteers every Sunday through August 31. We need even more volunteers once we return to two services on September 7, so if summer is too busy, please consider volunteering in the fall.  If you have questions about serving in the nursery, please contact Louise Van Iseghem.

**True North VBS**: Attention VBS volunteers: crew leaders, crew helpers, station leaders, station helpers, and nursery care. Please mark your calendar for our **True North VBS training**. Choose **one** of the following _mandatory_ trainings to attend: 

July 3 at 7pm

July 7 at 1pm

July 9 at 10am  

**Bundle Up Hope!** As part of **True North VBS**, our church will participate in **Operation Kid-to-Kid**. This **missions project** gives kids the chance to bring hope and warmth to kids in North America.  World Vision estimates about one of every six kids in the United States lives in poverty. These kids may have inadequate clothing as temperatures drop in the fall and winter. 

We can change that! We’ll join hundreds of thousands of children in partnership with World Vision, raising money to provide brand new warm clothes and blankets for kids in North America. During True North VBS, **kids and adults** will have the opportunity to **donate** to Operation Kid-to-Kid. A **$5 donation** can provide up to $70 worth of brand new warm clothes and blankets for a child in North America!
