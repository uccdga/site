This February, we continue to journey through John's Gospel. We will explore four very different encounters with Jesus. In each of these meetings the people involved are forever changed. As we experience these stories, they continue to speak to us today.

We begin in the temple courts (February 1), where Jesus finds God's house turned into a marketplace. With righteous anger, he overturns tables and drives out those who've made worship transactional. Jesus is then challenged to prove his authority. His words are shocking to those who heard them for the first time: "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it in three days." Jesus is not talking about the building. He's talking about his body and is pointing toward his death and resurrection.

Then we meet Nicodemus (February 8), a religious leader who comes to Jesus under cover of darkness. He has questions for Jesus. Jesus' words surprised Nicodemus. "You must be born from above." Nicodemus doesn't get this. We still struggle to understand. But Jesus isn't asking us to understand every detail. He's inviting us to experience new birth and to be transformed by God's Spirit moving like wind that "blows wherever it pleases."

On Transfiguration Sunday (February 15), Jesus speaks about his "hour." This is the moment everything has been moving toward. Again, Jesus' words catch us off guard. His hour of glory isn't found on a mountaintop in dazzling light. It's found on a cross. "Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies," Jesus says, "it remains alone. But if it dies, it produces many seeds." Glory through sacrifice. Life through death. Again, Jesus is pointing us to the Cross.

Finally, we travel with Jesus to Samaria (February 22), where he meets a woman at a well in the heat of the day. She comes alone in order to avoid everyone else. But Jesus doesn't avoid her. In fact, He seeks her out. He offers her "living water" that will satisfy her deepest thirst. This woman becomes the first evangelist in Samaria, running to tell everyone about the Savior of the world.

How do these stories connect? Each encounter with Jesus changes everything. The religious leaders learn Jesus is more than a miracle worker. He's the very presence of God. Nicodemus finds that entering God's kingdom requires being born anew. Those seeking Jesus find true glory at the cross. The Samaritan woman learns worship is about Spirit and truth, not location.

These aren't just ancient stories. Each one is an invitation for us today. This month, I invite you to read the passages each week before you come to worship. Pray that Jesus will speak to you through these readings and consider how His words will transform you.

You know, when we truly encounter Jesus, we never leave the same.
