**Sunday Morning Small Groups**  - Our  **young adult/adult ministries**  have begun the new year with a variety of Sunday School offerings. Our  **Young Adults**  **Group**  continue through select passages in Romans, using the SOAP method. The  **Bible Study Group**  that meets in the Downstairs Dining Hall continues with their study on James. The new  **Choir Group**  meets on the second floor (Room 26), and is now following the sermon series in the Gospel of John. The  **Parenting Group**  continues to meet in the Fellowship Room, and are (at the time of writing this article) determining their next topic/series.

**Mid-Week Connects**  - Our Ferris Hills group has been meeting monthly, which includes worship and a devotional. The Quail Summit group has started to meet, which has involved fellowship and snacks!

**Adult Ministry Bible Studies**  - As a reminder, we have a men's group that meets every Wednesday morning at 7am at the church for breakfast, fellowship, Bible study, and prayer. We also have a group of women that meet every Thursday at 1pm at the church - also a Bible study.

**Half-Day Women's Retreat**  - Inspired and supported by the discernment and effort of Nancy B. and Christy A., this retreat was been planned and scheduled for January 31, 10am-1pm. This was intended for an intergenerational setting, and (at the time of this writing) included more than 40 women registered! The study was being created by Christy and Nancy, and focused on examples of women in the Bible, and how women can support one another in life/faith.

**Passion Conference**  - We had two young adults (Grace P. and Jen P.) attend the Passion Conference in early January. This time, it was in Texas in an Major League Baseball stadium (with approximately 40,000 young adults in attendance). Grace and Jen kept us in the loop along the way - another year full of worship, devotion, and fellowship! Check out the picture!

**Young Adult Coffee Outing**  - In early January (home from college!), we had the rare opportunity to get several of our young adults together for a lunch outing after church. It was great to see all of them together. Check out the picture!
