This is the time of year when we begin to make plans. For some, that planning includes purchasing gifts for loved ones. For others, it means organizing a family gathering or arranging travel. We are preparing, getting ready for what is to come.

As we step into the season of Advent, we turn over the liturgical calendar to a new year. At the same time, we prepare our hearts for Jesus' coming. On the one hand, we join the people of old in their anticipation of the coming Messiah. For hundreds of years, the people of God waited for Him to come, to show up, to fulfill His promises. As far back as Genesis 3, God pointed to a time when sin and death would be conquered:

> (Genesis 3:15 NIV) "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."

This verse is known as the protoevangelium or the first gospel. Here, God, speaking to the serpent, gives us a glimpse of His plan for salvation and victory over sin and evil. Throughout the Old Testament, we find passages that point to Jesus' coming, from Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6-7 to Micah 5:2 and Zechariah 9:9. The season of Advent is a time of longing, of looking forward to all that God will do. And at Christmas, we celebrate the fulfillment of these promises.

Advent is also a season of anticipating Jesus' promise to return—to make all things right, to establish a new Kingdom and a new earth. We are living in between the comings of Jesus. So, as we reflect on the anticipation of His first coming, we also prepare for His second. As we plan for the holiday season, whether by purchasing gifts or making travel arrangements, let’s not neglect the spiritual preparation for Jesus' return.

I’ve included the Scripture passages below to aid in your worship preparation each week. Please note that December will include two combined services at 11 AM (December 22 and 29), and a Christmas Eve Candlelight Communion service at 7 PM. Our December 29 service will be a prayer service for the coming year.

Looking forward to engaging the Scriptures with you each week,

Wade
