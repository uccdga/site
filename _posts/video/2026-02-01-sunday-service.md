Jesus cleanses the temple with zeal, demonstrating that worship is not a transaction but an encounter with the living God. He declares that his body is the new temple where heaven and earth meet, pointing forward to his death and resurrection. This sermon challenges us to examine whether our faith is based on what Jesus can do for us or on who he truly is. He is the Messiah who died to save us and rose to give us life.
