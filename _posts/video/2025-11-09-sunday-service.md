This sermon explores 2 Peter 3:8-10, where Peter addresses complaints about the apparent delay in Jesus' return. The message shows how God's eternal perspective on time differs from our human impatience, and how His delay is actually motivated by patient love for people who need time to come to faith. The application challenges listeners to trust God's timing in their own lives, show patience with difficult people as God shows patience with them, and live ready for Christ's unexpected return.
