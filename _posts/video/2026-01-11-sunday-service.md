John the Baptist models humility as he points away from himself to Jesus. This sermon explores John's testimony about Jesus' identity as the Messiah, the sacrifice for sin, and the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. We are challenged to follow John's example by deflecting attention from ourselves and pointing others to Jesus, recognizing that our role is to be witnesses, not the main attraction.
