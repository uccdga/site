Join us for a special Christmas celebration as we gather together for one service at 11 AM. Our choir will present a beautiful cantata featuring five medleys of beloved Christmas music. This musical worship service will fill our hearts with joy as we celebrate the birth of our Savior through song. Come and be blessed by this gift of music as we prepare our hearts for Christmas Day.
