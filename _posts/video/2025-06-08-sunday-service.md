This Pentecost sermon explores Psalm 104:24-35, revealing how God's Spirit both creates and renews all life, drawing parallels between the breath that sustains creation and the Holy Spirit that empowered the early church. We will be invited to identify areas in our lives needing spiritual renewal - whether in relationships, work challenges, or personal faith journeys - and to depend on the same Spirit that ordered creation for guidance, refreshment, and transformation in our daily lives.
