This sermon explores Jesus' invitation to come and see as he calls his first disciples in John 1:35-51. We'll watch as different people respond to this invitation. Some come curious, others skeptical, but when they encounter Jesus, he reveals himself as the Son of God. The message calls skeptics to come experience Jesus for themselves and longtime believers to see him afresh with wonder.
