In this sermon about Jesus's return to Nazareth in Luke 4, we see how his hometown's initial warm reception quickly turned violent when he challenged their lack of faith by comparing them unfavorably to two Gentiles - the widow of Zarephath and Naaman the Syrian - who demonstrated true faith despite having less evidence than the townspeople had. The sermon concludes by asking listeners to examine whether they're more like the skeptical, self-sufficient people of Nazareth or like the desperate widow and Naaman who recognized their need and trusted God without demanding proof first.
