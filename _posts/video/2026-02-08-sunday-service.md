This Sunday we explore Jesus' nighttime conversation with Nicodemus about being born again. Jesus teaches that entering God's kingdom requires a spiritual birth that only God can give, worked by the Spirit like wind and water that cleanses. The passage culminates in John 3:16-17, reminding us that God sent his Son not to condemn but to save through the cross. Our worship should reflect themes of transformation, new life, the Spirit's work, and God's saving love.
