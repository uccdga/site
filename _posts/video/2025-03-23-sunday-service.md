Through Jesus's teaching on tragic events and the parable of the fig tree, this sermon explores how we often misunderstand God's judgment and calls us away from religious finger-pointing toward authentic repentance and a life-giving relationship with God. The message challenges us to examine our own hearts rather than judging others, while emphasizing God's desire for genuine spiritual fruit rather than mere rule-following.
