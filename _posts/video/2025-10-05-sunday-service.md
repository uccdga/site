This sermon explores 2 Peter 2:1-3 and Peter's warning about false teachers who work from within the church, using the Trojan horse as an illustration of how enemies can appear as gifts while bringing destruction. The message calls believers to know God's Word deeply, test all teaching against Scripture, and live authentically Christian lives that protect the church's witness.
