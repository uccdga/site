In his final words before execution, Peter challenges believers to guard their spiritual inheritance against subtle deception and to actively grow in grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ. This sermon concludes our 12-week journey through 2 Peter by bringing us full circle to the central question of what we do with everything God has given us. Pastor Wade will provide practical steps for both guarding against false teaching and growing deeper in relationship with Jesus, challenging the congregation to live like the spiritual millionaires they truly are.
