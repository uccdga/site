In this opening message from 2 Peter, we explore the apostle's final words to the church as he faces execution, emphasizing that God's divine power has already given us everything we need for godly living through His great and precious promises. Peter contrasts true knowledge of God that transforms our lives with the false knowledge claimed by corrupt teachers who treat God's costly grace as cheap. The application challenges us to listen deeply to Peter's final words and actively engage with God's promises for transformation, remembering that just as God transformed the failing fisherman Peter into a rock-solid apostle, He can transform us too.
