In this sermon on Luke 13:31-35, we explore Jesus' lament over Jerusalem through the metaphor of a mother hen yearning to gather her chicks, revealing both God's protective love for His people and the tragedy of their rejection, while ultimately pointing to Christ's determined mission toward the cross. The themes of divine protection, sacrificial love, and the invitation to come under God's wings are central to the message.
