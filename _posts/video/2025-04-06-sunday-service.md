In John 12, Mary's lavish gift of perfume to anoint Jesus demonstrates what extravagant worship looks like when we withhold nothing from Christ. Through her example, we explore how true devotion often defies conventional wisdom and involves sacrificial giving. This message challenges us to examine our own worship and asks whether we, like Mary, are willing to give our most precious offerings to Jesus.
