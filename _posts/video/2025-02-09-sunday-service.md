This sermon explores Jesus' calling of his first disciples in Luke 5:1-11, focusing particularly on Simon Peter's journey from a fisherman to a follower of Christ after witnessing a miraculous catch of fish. The sermon emphasizes the distinction between wanting Jesus to join our plans versus truly following Him as Master, highlighting how Simon and his companions immediately left everything behind when called. It concludes by contrasting their wholehearted response with examples from Luke 9 of would-be followers who made excuses, challenging listeners to consider their own level of commitment to following Jesus.
