In this sermon from 2 Peter 1:16-21, Peter defends the reliability of apostolic testimony and Scripture against false teachers who claimed the stories about Jesus were fabricated myths. Peter provides three powerful reasons we can trust what we've been told about Jesus: eyewitness testimony from the apostles, historical evidence like the Transfiguration, and the divine origin of Scripture itself. The message challenges us to take God's Word seriously in our daily lives, trusting it as our reliable guide through life's confusion until Jesus returns.
