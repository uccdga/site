This sermon examines how early Christians chose faithful living over cultural expectations, refusing to participate in pagan festivals despite social pressure from family and friends. Just as those believers faced ridicule for their convictions, modern Christians must discern which cultural practices align with God's design and which compromise our faith. The message challenges listeners to examine areas where social pressure may be pulling them away from God's calling and to recommit to living with eternal perspective.
