This sermon explores the celebration of Epiphany, emphasizing its roots in the early church as a continuation of the Christmas season, culminating on January 6. Drawing from the story of the Magi in Matthew 2, it highlights the significance of their journey, the symbolic meaning of their gifts, and their role in acknowledging Jesus as King, Priest, and Savior. The message also reflects on God's providence in the unfolding story of Jesus, including the family's escape to Egypt, symbolizing redemption and refuge.
