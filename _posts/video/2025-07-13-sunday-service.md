The sermon explores how Peter instructs Christians to navigate relationships with those in authority through humble submission and respectful conduct, drawing from 1 Peter 3:1-7. This teaching reveals how Christians can influence their world through Christ-like character rather than rebellion or confrontation. We will be challenged to examine our own relationships with authority figures and consider how practicing gentleness and respect might open doors for witness in our homes, workplaces, and communities.
