This prayer service brings the church together to pray for each ministry area, from family and missions to worship and church leadership. Through a mix of Scripture, hymns, and focused prayers, we’re asking for God’s guidance and strength for everyone serving. It’s a chance to show our gratitude and support, lifting up each team as they do their work in the church and community.
