Jesus's radical command to love our enemies goes far beyond natural human inclinations, as demonstrated powerfully in his own love for Judas and his death on the cross for sinners. In Luke 6:27-38, Jesus calls his followers to respond to hatred with good deeds, to curses with blessings, and to mistreatment with prayer. It is a way of living that seems impossible by human standards but becomes possible through God's power working in us.
