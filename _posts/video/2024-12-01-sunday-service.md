This sermon, focused on the first Sunday of Advent, emphasizes the importance of living with urgency and expectation as we await both the celebration of Christ’s birth and His promised return. Through exploring Luke 21:25-36, the message encourages believers to remain vigilant and not be weighed down by the anxieties of life, but to stand ready for Christ’s ultimate redemption. It calls the congregation to embrace the Advent season as a time of anticipation, preparing not just for Christmas, but for the fulfillment of God’s kingdom.
