Peter's final letter emphasizes the importance of constant reminding in the Christian life, as he reflects on his coming death and his urgent desire to stir up believers' faith while he still can. Using the metaphor of living in tents, Peter shows that our earthly life is brief, which should create urgency in how we strengthen one another and pass on God's truth to future generations. The sermon challenges us to embrace our need for spiritual reminders, live with eternal perspective, and actively invest in leaving lasting reminders of faith for those who come after us.
