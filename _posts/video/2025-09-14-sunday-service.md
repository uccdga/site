Based on 2 Peter 1:5-11, this sermon explores how Christians often possess incredible spiritual resources from God but fail to utilize them for growth and maturity. The message teaches through Peter's ladder of spiritual growth - eight qualities that build from faith to love - showing how we're called to make every effort in developing our spiritual lives as a response to God's grace. The sermon challenges listeners to prioritize spiritual growth through practical steps like scheduled prayer and Bible study, regular spiritual self-examination, and living with an eternal perspective.
