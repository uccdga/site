Peter uses three powerful Old Testament examples of fallen angels, Noah's flood, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah to demonstrate that God's perfect justice and perfect mercy work together throughout history. Through these stories of both judgment and rescue, we see that God has never failed to deal with rebellion while also protecting those who trust Him. We are challenged to stand faithfully for God's truth even when the world mocks it, while offering hope that God's mercy is still available to those who turn to Him in repentance and faith.
