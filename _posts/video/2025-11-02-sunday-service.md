In 2 Peter 3:1-7, Peter addresses scoffers who mock the delay of Christ's return by reminding believers that God has always kept His promises throughout history. Just as God judged the world through Noah's flood, He will return to judge again, this time by fire. Believers should live with urgency and readiness, trusting God's perfect timing rather than being swayed by skeptics who deliberately forget God's faithfulness.
