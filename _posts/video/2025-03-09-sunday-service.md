This sermon from Luke 4:1-13 explores Jesus's forty-day wilderness temptations and how he remained faithful through the power of the Spirit and Scripture. By examining the three specific temptations - using power for personal comfort, taking shortcuts to authority, and testing God's promises - we learn practical ways to face our own spiritual battles during this Lenten season. The message emphasizes that victory over temptation comes through being filled with the Spirit and staying grounded in God's Word.
