This sermon explores Psalm 122, a Song of Ascent that captures the joy of pilgrimage to Jerusalem and connects with our Advent longing for Christ's coming. The congregation will be challenged to find joy in worship, build unified community, pray for God's peace, and make personal commitments to work for the good of God's people during this season of anticipation.
