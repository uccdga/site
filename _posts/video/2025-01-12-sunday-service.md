We are called to embrace humility and dependence on God as modeled by John the Baptist and Jesus during His baptism, recognizing our roles in God's greater plan and our need for the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. By following their example, we too are equipped to continue Jesus' mission in the world, relying on Godâ€™s guidance and strength to live out our faith actively and purposefully.
