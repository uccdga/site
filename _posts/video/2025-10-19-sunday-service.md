This sermon examines 2 Peter 2:10b-16, where Peter describes false teachers as blots and blemishes who are arrogant, greedy, and motivated by selfish gain. Using the example of Balaam, Peter shows how these teachers abandon the right path to pursue personal profit, becoming so spiritually blind that they have less discernment than Balaam's talking donkey. The application challenges believers to recognize the warning signs of false teaching, guard their own hearts against pride and greed, and stay grounded in God's Word.
