In this sermon from 1 Peter 2:4-10, we explore how Christians are living stones being built into God's spiritual house with Christ as the cornerstone — rejected by the world but precious to believers. Just as ancient stone structures have stood for centuries, God is building an enduring spiritual kingdom through each of us. Christians apply this truth by becoming living stones through daily acts of worship—sharing faith, helping those in need, forgiving others, volunteering their time, praying diligently, and standing for what's right even when unpopular.
