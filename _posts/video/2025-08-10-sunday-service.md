This sermon explores 1 Peter 4:12-19, where Peter teaches that suffering for our faith should not surprise us but be seen as a blessing that connects us to Christ's suffering and glory. Peter challenges believers to reject prosperity gospel thinking and understand that genuine discipleship often comes with a cost. The application calls Christians to commit themselves faithfully to God during difficult times, trusting His Spirit rather than abandoning their faith when following Jesus becomes costly.
