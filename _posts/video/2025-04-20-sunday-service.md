Drawing from Psalm 118, this Easter sermon explores how God turns rejection into redemption through Christ's resurrection, focusing on the powerful image of the rejected stone becoming the cornerstone of our faith. The sermon weaves together ancient temple worship and New Testament fulfillment to celebrate how Christ's resurrection opens the gates of righteousness for all believers.
