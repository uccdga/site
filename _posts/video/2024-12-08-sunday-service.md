The sermon on Philippians 1:3-11, given during Advent, focuses on Paul’s sense of urgency and expectation as he anticipates the return of Christ. The message emphasizes Paul’s confidence that God, who began a good work in the believers at Philippi, will carry it to completion, encouraging the congregation to live with the same expectancy for Christ’s return. The challenge is for the church to grow in love, discernment, and righteousness, living with an active anticipation that Christ will one day make all things right.
