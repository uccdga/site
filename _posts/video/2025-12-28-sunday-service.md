This New Year Prayer Service will be structured around our three pastoral prayer focuses: World, Community, and Church Family, with each section expanded to allow extended time for corporate intercession and reflection. The service invites the congregation to intentionally close out 2025 and welcome 2026 by seeking God's presence and guidance through prayer. Our prayers will include lifting up global suffering, local needs, and church family concerns as we trust in God's faithfulness for the year ahead.1
