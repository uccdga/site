This sermon on 1 Peter 5:12-14 explores how Christians are called to stand firm in God's grace while living as exiles in a culture that no longer centers faith. The message challenges congregants to examine whether they will maintain their commitments to church and faith or allow cultural pressures around time, money, and competing priorities to draw them away from being the church God has called them to be.
