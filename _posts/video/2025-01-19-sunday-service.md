This sermon explores Jesus' first miracle at the Cana wedding feast, explaining how He transformed water into wine not merely to solve a practical problem, but to reveal His identity as the Messiah and point to God's greater work of redemption. Using Mary's response as a model, the sermon shows how believers can bring their immediate needs to Jesus while recognizing His larger purpose in bringing about God's kingdom.
