In this sermon from 1 Peter 1:13-2:3, we explore how Christians can live holy lives while feeling like exiles in a changing culture. Peter calls believers to stay alert and sober-minded, setting their hope on God's grace while resisting conformity to the empty ways of the world. Through regular spiritual nourishment and a reorientation of our understanding, we can grow in holiness, love one another deeply, and experience the enduring goodness of God's Word in our daily lives.
