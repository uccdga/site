Missions Sunday is a special service where we celebrate God's work around the world and in our own backyard through testimonies from mission experiences. Our congregation will hear firsthand accounts of God's faithfulness and transformative work from recent mission trips to North Carolina, Nicaragua, and Mexico, as well as inspiring stories from local outreach efforts right here in our community. This is an opportunity to witness how God is moving through ordinary people to accomplish His extraordinary purposes both near and far.
