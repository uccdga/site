In this sermon on 1 Peter 3:8-17, we explore how Christians are called to live authentically as exiles in a rapidly changing culture where faith is no longer the norm. As followers of Jesus, we are challenged to build genuine community marked by unity, sympathy, brotherly love, compassion, and humilityâ€”qualities that stand in stark contrast to our surrounding culture. Christians today can apply these principles by intentionally cultivating these five characteristics in their relationships with fellow believers, which will not only strengthen the church but also create natural opportunities to share their faith with a watching world.
