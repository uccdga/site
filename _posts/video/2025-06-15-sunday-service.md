This sermon examines 1 Peter's paradoxical description of believers as both chosen by God yet exiles in the world, explaining how this ancient letter speaks directly to Christians experiencing cultural marginalization today. Peter's teaching reveals how trials can refine our faith like gold while God's promises offer an inheritance that never fades. For application, the congregation will be encouraged to embrace their identity as exiles through simple acts of kindness and by finding strength in community when facing resistance because of their faith.
