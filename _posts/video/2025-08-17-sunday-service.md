This sermon from 1 Peter 5:1-11 explores how God calls all believers to live with humility and servant hearts, whether in church leadership or daily Christian living. Peter encourages Christians facing persecution and difficulty to cast their anxieties on God rather than trying to maintain control, while staying alert to spiritual opposition. The message challenges listeners to examine where anxiety may be ruling their lives and calls them to actively trust God by releasing their worries to Him, knowing that He cares for them and has ultimate power over every situation.
