This sermon explores Psalm 97's powerful vision of God's sovereign rule over creation, where even mountains melt like wax in His presence. The message challenges us to examine the modern idols competing for our trust, to release our anxiety about the future knowing God reigns, to stand in appropriate awe of His majesty, to rejoice that He brings justice to our broken world, and ultimately to become light-bearers who reflect God's righteousness in our homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces as we transform our worries into worship.
