Through an examination of Jesus' anguished prayer in Gethsemane (Luke 22:39-49), this sermon explores the tension between cultural messages of self-fulfillment and Jesus' example of submitting to the Father's will, challenging us to pray against temptation and align ourselves with God's purposes rather than our own desires.
