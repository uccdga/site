In this sermon, we explore how Christians today are increasingly finding themselves as foreigners and exiles in a culture that no longer understands Christian values, much like the early church Peter addressed in his first epistle. Drawing from 1 Peter 2:11-25, we examine God's call for believers to abstain from sinful desires and submit to authority, even when difficult. As we navigate our changing cultural landscape, we're challenged to follow Christ's example by living distinctively through submission, respect, and love, so that our good deeds might cause others to glorify God.
