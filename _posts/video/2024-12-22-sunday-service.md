We are called to embrace the disruptive presence of God in our lives as Mary did, willingly submitting ourselves to His purposes despite personal inconvenience or societal judgment. We should actively respond to God's call with obedience and joy, trusting His plan and preparing to participate fully in His promises, as exemplified by Mary's faith-filled affirmation to being part of God's redemptive work.
