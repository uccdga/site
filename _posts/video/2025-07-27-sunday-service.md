This sermon explores the challenging passage of 1 Peter 3:18-22, focusing on how Christ's death and resurrection demonstrate His complete victory over all spiritual powers, including the mysterious proclamation to imprisoned spirits from Noah's time. Peter uses this profound spiritual reality to encourage suffering first-century Christians that there is more happening than what they can see on the surface. We are called to recognize that in our current broken world, Christ's resurrection power gives us hope and assurance that God remains in control, even when we feel like a minority surrounded by opposition.
