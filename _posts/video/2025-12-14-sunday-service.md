This sermon explores Psalm 146:5-10 and the Advent theme of longing for God to make all things right in our broken world. The message contrasts temporary human solutions with God's eternal faithfulness and his work of caring for the vulnerable like the oppressed, hungry, and marginalized. The application calls listeners to place their hope in God rather than human leaders while actively joining his work of caring for those in need, requiring faith to trust God's timeline even when circumstances suggest delay.
