After Peter declares Jesus is the Messiah, and after Jesus prophecies his death and resurrection, Jesus brings a few disciples onto a mountain and appears to them in glorious light, in a well-known scene often called The Transfiguration. In our sermon, we will consider the importance and the purpose of this revelation, and what it is that God invites us into through this story.
