This June and July, join us in our Senior Companion Summer Card Ministry, a simple and meaningful way to show care and connection.

Our Senior Companions (previously known as "special members") are those in our church family who are aging or facing ongoing health challenges and may be less able to attend in-person gatherings. When you send a handwritten card, you're offering more than words, you're sending encouragement, connection, and the reminder that they are loved and not forgotten.

A table will be set up starting June 1 with names, addresses, and cards available for you to take. Feel free to send one card or many throughout the summer months!

Let's work together to brighten someone's day and strengthen the bonds of love in our church family, one card at a time.
