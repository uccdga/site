**Consider Serving on a Care Team**

As a new year begins, many of us pause to think about where we are and who we're becoming. We make resolutions about health, habits, family, and time. But what if this year's resolution looked a little different?

What if your resolution wasn't simply to  _do_  something new… but to  _be_  someone who faithfully uses the gifts God has given you?

Scripture tells us that the body of Christ is made of many parts-each one essential, each one shaped for a purpose (1 Corinthians 12). Every smile, every prayer, every meal delivered, every visit to someone who is hurting is a reflection of Christ's compassion. Some serve by listening. Others by hospitality. Some through writing cards, providing transportation, or sitting quietly with someone who needs a steady presence.

If you've felt a nudge to serve, or if you're unsure where to begin, this may be the moment to ask, "Lord, where would You have me use my talents this year?"

Our Care Ministry has several Care Teams, each offering simple but meaningful ways to support individuals and families facing illness, grief, transitions, or practical needs. Whether you have one hour a month or one hour a week, there is a place for your gifts to shine.

You don't need special skills, just a heart that is willing. Training is provided, support is ongoing, and we serve as a team. You won't do ministry alone.

If you're curious, if you feel led, or if you want to learn more about where your gifts might fit,  **I would love to talk with you.**  Let's prayerfully explore how God may be inviting you to serve this year.

To learn more or schedule a conversation, please talk with  **Christy**.
