This month, we express our sincere gratitude to two Stewards who are concluding their service on the Board.

**Rachel**  has faithfully served for  **six years**, offering steady leadership, compassion, and deep relational care to her Senior Companions. Her long-term dedication has been a gift to our church family, and her presence has shaped the ministry in meaningful ways.

**Wanda**  has served for  **three years**, bringing warmth, kindness, and a genuine heart for those she visits. Her love for our Senior Companions has been evident through every call, conversation, and connection.

Together, through visits, phone calls, prayers, and countless acts of encouragement, Rachel and Wanda have reflected Christ's love with humility and grace. In addition to their companionship ministry, they have also faithfully prepared and cared for the sacred elements of communion, serving our congregation in quiet, reverent ways that often go unseen but are deeply appreciated.

As they conclude their service, we celebrate the ways God has worked through them. Their ministry has made a difference, and we are deeply grateful.

**_Thank you, Rachel and Wanda, for serving faithfully and loving well_**

You have helped nurture a caring community at The United Church.

_With gratitude, we pray God's blessing over you in the season ahead,  
that your service continues to bear fruit,  
and that His joy fills you as you follow His calling._

**"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others… as faithful stewards of God's grace." -- 1 Peter 4:10**
