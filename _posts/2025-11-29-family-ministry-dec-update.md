During the month of November, our Sunday school kids were invited to take part in our  **Mission Project**. Each Sunday, kids were invited to bring in  **donations for local food pantries**. Our goal was to bring in 50 items over the course of the month. At the end of November, we will count up the donations.  **We may meet or exceed our goal - how exciting!**  God knew the need would be great this month, and placed it on the heart of the Family Ministry Team early in 2025 to plan this project. May all we do be for His glory!

**Youth Club**  kids filled  **46 stockings**  for Metro World Child on Wednesday, November 12th. These stockings were then mailed to  **Metro World Child**  in  **Brooklyn**. The stockings are given to children in need during a special Christmas program for families. Everyone who attends this program hears the gospel message.  _Thank you to the many people who helped with this project!_  It was a  **true team effort**  of felt cutters, stocking sewers, stocking stuffer donations, and creativity of the Youth Club kids. Please pray that these stockings will be tangible evidence of Christ’s love to those who receive them.

Sunday school kids are preparing for our  **Christmas Pageant**. We have been singing songs together for many weeks now. Children aged 3 years old through 12th grade who would like to be a part of this year’s pageant, we will have  **one  _mandatory_  practice on Saturday, December 13th from 9:30-11:30am**  in the sanctuary. The Christmas Pageant will take place  **Sunday, December 14th**  **during the Sunday school hour (at 10:00)**  in the sanctuary. On December 14th, _children in the pageant need to arrive at 9:30 to get into costumes_. The pageant will be followed by a birthday party for Jesus in the fellowship room.

The season of  **Advent**  is the 4 weeks prior to Christmas when we prepare our hearts for the coming Messiah. Children and youth will receive Advent devotionals in Sunday School. Let us know if you need one!

-   For preschool:  **“Silent Night, Holy Night”**  allows kids to build a display and add stickers for each day of Advent. Each day, kids read scripture, read a short poem about part of the Christmas story, and place a sticker on their display.
-   For Kindergarten through 5th grade:  **“Look Around the Stable”**  These daily devotions include short story, question, and a prayer for families to read together. This devotional also includes a chain that allows children to add to each day.
-   For Middle School: **"Heads up, the Lord is Near”**  These daily devotionals for students include scripture, questions, or actions, depending on the day.
-   For High School: Pastor Mark has selected Advent devotions for high school students.

This year Advent begins on November 30th. It is our hope that families will set aside a special time each day to come together and share in the anticipation of Jesus’ birth. **O Come, Let Us Adore Him!**
