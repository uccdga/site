It’s already February, but the year is still fresh with possibilities! As is my yearly tradition, this time of year prompts me to reflect and set some intentional goals to grow, both spiritually and practically. I know many of you do the same, and I’ve learned over the years that while I may not accomplish everything on my list, setting realistic, attainable goals is key. This is a challenge for the perfectionist in me.

Through this process, I’ve learned to invite God into the goal-setting, asking Him to guide me—because sometimes His priorities for me don’t align with my own. The more I lean into His guidance, the more I see my list shaping into what truly matters.  I’ve also learned that this time of making changes and setting goals does not need to be confined to the beginning of a new calendar year. And, in fact, it probably should happen more often than that. 
          
 While I’m not going to share with you every goal I am working on, I’ve been reflecting on the vital role that parents play in their children's faith formation. Parents have a unique opportunity to influence their kids in ways no one else can, and it’s important to me to equip them with practical tools to make those faith conversations meaningful and consistent at home. It’s not about adding more to a parent’s to-do list, but about walking alongside them, offering support and encouragement where it’s most needed.
 
 I know parents are already juggling a lot—life, work, school, activities—and I don’t want to add pressure. Instead, I want to offer simple, accessible resources that make it easier to bring faith into everyday life. It's not about doing more; it’s about doing it together.  And it’s crucial you do what works for your family, which may be different than what works for another family.
 
 I encourage you to explore the parent-child library in the upstairs chapel, which has been thoughtfully updated and is always growing. Take a moment this month to try out one of the resources available and let me know how it goes! Share what’s worked for your family, and don’t hesitate to let me know if something doesn’t work well. Your feedback is essential as we continue to work together.  Let’s be a team, with the goal of helping your children fall in love with Jesus and carry their faith into adulthood. This journey isn’t always easy, but it’s incredibly important.

> “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.” Deuteronomy 6:4-9
