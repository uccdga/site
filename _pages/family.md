title: Family Ministry
description: The Family Ministry supports the spiritual growth of all ages within our church. Through tailored programs for adults, children, youth, and young adults—such as Sunday school, small groups, retreats, and mission opportunities—we foster faith and community. The Children and Youth Teams offer age-appropriate activities and service projects, while the Young Adult Team provides support for college students and young professionals. Together, these ministries help everyone grow in faith.
