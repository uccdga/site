title: Care Ministry
description: Our Care Ministry is dedicated to nurturing and supporting our church family with acts of kindness, compassion, and practical assistance. We aim to create a culture of care where every individual feels valued, supported, and empowered to thrive. Through teams such as Stewards, Meal Trains, Helping Hands, and more, we provide essential support in times of need, including food, financial aid, transportation, and companionship. At the heart of our ministry is a deep commitment to embodying Christ's love, offering hope, and helping individuals navigate their challenges while fostering a community where everyone belongs.
