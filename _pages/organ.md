## The Organ  

Installed in 2015, Parsons Pipe Organ Builders' Opus 41 is a three-manual and pedal pipe organ featuring 35 registers, 51 stops, 40 ranks, and 2,467 pipes. This remarkable instrument is organized into four divisions: Great, Swell, Choir, and Pedal. Each division has its own unique keyboard and serves a specific purpose.  

The divisions are housed in opposing chambers at the front of the sanctuary, behind decorative pipe facades and screens on either side of the chancel. The Swell and Pedal divisions are located in the left chamber, while the Great and Choir divisions reside in the right chamber. Both the Swell and Choir divisions are fully enclosed with 2¼-inch thick maple louvers that open and close to control volume.  

The unenclosed Great and Pedal divisions, positioned in front of the enclosed divisions, deliver powerful, room-filling sound to support congregational singing and provide tonal foundation. Strategic chancel tone openings ensure that the organ’s sound blends seamlessly throughout the sanctuary and is clear and concise for musicians in the chancel area.  

Designed specifically for The United Church, Opus 41 transitions effortlessly from ethereal, soft tones to majestic, resounding chords, enriching the worship experience with its versatility and grandeur.

## Structural Considerations, Key Action, and Winding  

Opus 41 features space-efficient electric-slider windchests with minimal unification. Prior to its installation, church trustees worked with Parsons Pipe Organ Builders and Bero Architecture, a Rochester-based firm specializing in historic buildings, to create structurally sound chambers capable of supporting the organ's weight.  

A specialized winding room was constructed behind the organ, spanning the full width of the sanctuary. This room houses the organ's two blowers, twin wedge bellows, and humidification components. Additionally, micro-climate systems in the chambers circulate air continuously, optimizing tuning stability and preserving the instrument's performance.

## The Console  

The organ console is the central control point, allowing organists to play and shape the organ’s sound. Opus 41’s console includes:  
- **Three manual keyboards** and one pedal keyboard for the Great, Swell, Choir, and Pedal divisions.  
- **Drawknobs** for selecting stops (specific pitches and sounds).  
- **Couplers** to link divisions across keyboards or octaves.  
- **Thumb and toe pistons** for quickly selecting combinations of stops and couplers.  
- **Expression pedals** for adjusting volume in the enclosed divisions.  

The console is equipped with advanced features, including a digital recording system that captures keystrokes, stop selections, and expression settings in real-time. This feature allows organists to playback and refine their performance while assessing balance, tempo, and volume from anywhere in the sanctuary.  

Parsons’ signature low-profile terraced drawknob design complements the console’s construction. Its exterior is made of black walnut, with bloodwood accents and a music rack crafted from book-matched walnut burl with blackwood inlays. The manual keyboards feature bone naturals and ebony sharps. For mobility, the console is fitted with a built-in steel dolly, enabling it to be easily moved around the chancel platform.

## Acoustics  

The acoustics of the sanctuary play a critical role in enhancing the organ’s tonal qualities. Like a piano’s soundboard or a violin’s body, the sanctuary serves as a resonating chamber. Hard, reflective surfaces amplify and enrich the harmonics of the organ pipes.  

To optimize acoustics, the church replaced chancel carpeting with hardwood flooring and reinforced the walls and ceilings of the organ chambers. These adjustments have significantly improved the organ’s tonal bloom and overall performance.

## Appearance  

The visual design of Opus 41 is as stunning as its sound. The twin pipe facades are a striking addition to the sanctuary, incorporating architectural elements such as brackets, rosettes, finials, and egg-and-dart moldings that harmonize with the room’s existing features.  

The stenciling on the organ casework mirrors the sanctuary ceiling’s intricate patterns and colors. Every effort was made to respect the sanctuary’s historic character while creating a visual statement that reflects the organ’s prominence.  

Together, the auditory and visual elements of Parsons Opus 41 enrich worship at The United Church, creating an inspiring environment for all who gather.
