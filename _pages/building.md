## The Building

Our sanctuary, built in 1871, is a beautiful example of Gothic Revival architecture. Gothic churches were designed to point toward God, with elements that inspire worshippers to look up—both physically and spiritually—toward heaven. The architecture features:

- **Pointed Arches**: Used for both strength and decoration.
- **Buttresses**: Helped create thinner walls compared to Romanesque architecture.
- **Tall Stained Glass Windows**: These windows were designed to filter colored light into the building, symbolizing God's story.
- **High Tower with a Spire**: A classic Gothic feature, symbolizing the reach of God’s kingdom.
- **Rose Window**: Positioned above the entrance, this window is a key architectural and symbolic feature of the church.
- **Gothic Elements in the Church**: Our sanctuary includes a chancel (also called the choir), nave (pew area), aisles, narthex, and tower. The spire was removed for safety, and the tower roof lowered in 1968.
- **Stenciling in the Ceiling**: Mike O’Brien’s father, Walter, stenciled gold leaf designs (~1950), and Ellen Parsons matched this in the organ pipe facades in 2015.
- **Cornerstone Box**: Laid in 1871, the cornerstone holds a box filled with items from the time, including church history, membership records, coins, stamps, and local newspapers. The contents are displayed in a frame in the Fellowship Room.
- **Craftsmanship by Connie Carpenter**: Connie Carpenter created the table/cabinet by the Gathering Area entrance, along with other cabinets in the sanctuary, including those for the sound system.

## Symbolism

Every element of our sanctuary speaks to God’s presence and His story. The architecture and furnishings invite worshippers into a deeper relationship with the Divine.

### The Reredos

The reredos, the decorated part of the wall behind the chancel, is designed to help us sense that God is confronting us in the sanctuary—ready to hear our prayers and bless us. Key features include:

- **Candles on Either Side of the Cross**: These candles shed light on the carved open Bibles above, reminding us of God's revelation through Christ and His Word.
- **Self-Giving Love**: The reredos symbolizes God’s love in Christ, our Creator and Redeemer. It is here that we place our offerings during worship.
- **Three Plaques on the Left**: These plaques represent:
  - Left: The 6-pointed star symbolizing Creation.
  - Middle: The eternal Triune God, represented by three intertwined, unbroken circles.
  - Right: The world redeemed through the cross of Christ.
- **Three Plaques on the Right**: These symbols include:
  - Left: The shield of faith.
  - Middle: The anchor of hope.
  - Right: The heart of love. All three contain a cross, signifying that faith, hope, and love are rooted in Christ.
- **Reliefs of the Four Gospels**: Ancient symbols representing Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
- **Angels**: Representing God’s ministering angels, sent to minister to those who are heirs of salvation (Heb. 1:14).
- **“IHS” Christogram**: The Greek letters for Jesus Christ’s name, reminding us of His central role in our faith.

### The Communion Table

The communion table is a powerful symbol of the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. It proclaims our oneness with Christ and with one another, reminding us of our common fellowship in Him.

### The Baptisteries

Baptism represents the washing away of sins through Christ’s sacrifice. The sunken baptistery, added in the late 1940s, symbolizes our new life in Christ and our connection to the covenant through Abraham. It was created after the American Baptist congregation joined worship with the Presbyterians following the fire in 1942.

### The Pulpit and Lectern

The pulpit and lectern serve as the places where God’s Word is read, prayer is lifted, sermons are delivered, and the people are called to offer their lives in service to God.

## The Stained Glass Windows

The stained glass windows were originally designed to keep the sacred space holy and tell the story of God's nature. The original windows were destroyed in a hailstorm, but many have been restored.

### Rose Window

Originally above the main entrance, this window symbolizes the coming of the Messianic Age. The late afternoon and evening sun streams through its vibrant colors, symbolizing the dispelling of darkness and the dawning of a new day.

### Narthex Window

The Gabriel stained glass window, installed in 2001, was placed in what was originally the entrance of the church. 

### Stained Glass Panels between the Sanctuary and Narthex

These original stained glass windows survived the hailstorm and are rich in symbolism. On the north side, near the exit, you’ll find:

- **Lamb of God/Sword/Cross**: Representing Jesus’ sacrifice.
- **Pi Symbol over the Cross**: Signifying infinity and the eternal nature of God.
- **Bible**: Symbolizing the Word of God.

On the south side, as you enter the sanctuary:

- **Chalice and Vines**: Representing communion and connection with Christ.
- **Hourglass**: A symbol of Judgment and the Second Coming.
- **Stone Tablets with the 10 Commandments**: Representing God’s law.

## The Tower and Chapel

In 1890, a tower was built between the church and the chapel, allowing a passageway for carriages. This passageway was eventually turned into our current Main Street entrance. Over time, the chapel was demolished in 1972 due to structural issues. In the same year, the Education Building was added to the east side of the church.

## The Five Stained Glass Windows on the North Side

These windows represent the Triune God and His covenants of Law and Grace. The pointed arches in these windows mirror the design of the sanctuary’s architecture and chandeliers, reinforcing the Triune theme. Each window has a unique symbol, including:

1. **Seal of the Trinity**: Represents the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
2. **Hand of God**: Symbolizes the Father’s provision and care.
3. **Christ**: Represented by Greek letters, showing Jesus as the beginning and the end.
4. **Descending Dove**: Symbolizes the Holy Spirit.
5. **Covenant of Work and Grace**: The scroll of the law and the Ark of the Covenant represent God’s justice and mercy.

## Additional Historical Information

The history of The United Church spans back to the 19th century. In 1870, Presbyterians bought the Barlow property and laid the cornerstone in 1871. The church has had 15 pastors, with Rev. Jim Kerr serving the longest tenure at 28 years. The church was renovated and renamed The United Church in 1961, reflecting the unity between the Presbyterian and American Baptist congregations. Significant events include:

- **1942**: The American Baptist Church was destroyed by fire.
- **1947**: Baptists began worshipping jointly with the Presbyterians.
- **1973**: The Christian Education Building was erected.
- **1990**: Rev. James Kerr began his pastorate.
- **2015**: A new pipe organ was completed.
- **2018-2019**: A Building Preservation Project restored windows, brickwork, and the front door.

We are proud to celebrate the beauty, history, and rich symbolism of our building, which continues to inspire and guide us as we worship and serve the community.
