## Giving at The United Church

A guideline that the Bible offers for the giving of wealth is a **tithe**. Tithe means 10%, thus ten percent of income goes to the work of the Lord. As a spiritual discipline, giving a percentage of wealth is a valuable method of keeping the Lord always first, and wealth (and all else) in its proper place.

## Offering at Church

You may place your donations in the offering plate passed during the Sunday services, or mail them to the church office.

## [Pledging](https://bit.ly/ucc-pledge)

[Pledging](https://bit.ly/ucc-pledge) the amounts that you intend to give each year helps the church to plan the budgets for the next year. The United Church separates pledged amounts into money given towards the **Operational Expenses** of the church and **Missions** of the church.
