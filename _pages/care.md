## Core Mission

We foster hope and belonging by providing practical assistance, emotional support, and spiritual encouragement to those in need. Our trained Care Teams offer a safe, understanding space where individuals can share their challenges and find strength in Christ's love.

## Ministry Teams

### Board of Stewards
A ministry of presence and care for those who are 90 and above, or in a season of life where additional friendship and support are especially meaningful. This ministry celebrates those who have reached a special season of life, marked by wisdom, faith, and enduring grace, offering friendship, meaningful connection, and compassionate support.

Stewards share in meaningful friendships with their Senior Companions, growing together through visits, conversation, prayer, and the joy of shared faith.

 They also oversee various church services, including communion preparation, holiday celebrations, and remembrance services.
